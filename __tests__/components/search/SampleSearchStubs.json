So I've been practicing.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> My favorite video on cornering a mountain bike\r\n    is <a href=\"https://youtu.be/8y6ocZHpLoE\">this one by The Loam\r\n    Ranger</a>. I love that he establishes that leaning\r\n    the <em>bike</em> is key. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Focusing on that really helped. But something still wasn't\r\n    clicking. The video above on cornering motorcycles really helped.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> What I noticed was that the rider was setting up for the U-turn by\r\n    shifting his hips to the outside of the turn. Basically, for a\r\n    left turn, he'd put his left butt cheek on the saddle, and\r\n    vice-versa for the right.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> When I tried that, a few things happened naturally:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li> I made more space for my saddle to lean into the turn.\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li> Rather than trying to drop my outside foot all the way to the\r\n        \"6 o'clock\" position at the bottom of the stroke, I adopted a\r\n        stance with my inside foot <em>slightly</em> higher than my\r\n        outside foot, which I've heard called the \"60/40 stance\".\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li> That, in turn, let me lean the bike <em>much</em> more\r\n        easily, getting those all-important turning lugs planted in\r\n        the dirt.\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p> And all of this felt <em>much</em> more natural than ever\r\n    before. I feel more secure in the turns, and it feels so much more\r\n    secure than ever before.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> And the proof is in the pudding. There were <em>so</em> many\r\n    moments during last night's race where I was clearly carrying more\r\n    momentum through turns than before. In places where I used to just\r\n    be part of the conga line going through a twisty section, I was\r\n    often picking up time on the riders around me.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> My training goals for the rest of 2022 boil down to:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n    <li> get leaner (ideally, weight around 175#)\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li> build trail skills\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li> build my ability to sustain race pace with periodic 30- to\r\n        90-second punches at 400-500W.\r\n    </li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p> It's really great to be making solid progress on #2 there.\r\n</p>",

    "intro": "<p> I've adjusted my training & nutrition to prioritize fat loss, and\r\n    it's working ever so gradually, just like it should. But man…\r\n    doing this The Right Way is... HARD.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p> It's going well. I'm down ~10lbs over ~4 months. I spoke with a\r\n    dietitian & implemented a few of her recommendations:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>less sugar/simple carbs</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> On days I don't ride, I've swapped my high-carb oatmeal breakfast\r\n    for scrambled eggs & a slice of toast. Snacks feature\r\n    veggies/hummus, etc.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>prebiotics & probiotics, fiber</b>\r\n\r\n<p> I now supplement to support gut biome health:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li> breakfast: fiber supplement\r\n    </li> \r\n    <li> lunch: prebiotics\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li> dinner: probiotics\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>more sleep</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> It's easy to stay up watching TV or playing games or\r\n    doomscrolling, and for me that results in ~6½hrs of sleep per\r\n    night. Getting in bed earlier & pushing that toward 7½hrs has\r\n    really helped.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>NOPE: more veggies</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I've gotten some more veggies into my diet, but not nearly\r\n    enough. There's 100% room for improvement here.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p> I've also made some adjustments to my training to prioritize fat\r\n    loss.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>consistently make time for weight training</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> My love of biking often leads me to want to skip my Thursday's\r\n    barbell session so I can give Friday's ride my all. But for me,\r\n    consistently doing SOMETHING every day is FAR more conducive to\r\n    fat loss than going hard every other day.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I have to remember that a new PR is nice, but what I really want\r\n    is a whole <em>stack</em> of new PRs as payoff for dropping this\r\n    extra fat I'm carrying around. I'll be healthier\r\n    &amp; <em>significantly</em> faster if I drop the extra weight.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p> <b>on-bike fueling</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I usually put Gu Roctane in both bottles. That keeps me fueled\r\n    through the end of the ride, which is good for recovery. But it\r\n    also means more sugar in my system than I really need. So now it's\r\n    1 bottle of Roctane, 1 of water.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> That cuts just 250 Cal from my daily intake, and my rides\r\n    typically burn 800-1400 Cal. But I find that\r\n    cutting <em>sugar</em> in particular has an outsized effect on\r\n    body composition.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p> <b>What's the Goal?</b>\r\n\r\n<p> I'm starting to notice clothes fitting differently, and\r\n    I'm <em>maybe</em> starting to notice that I'm feelign stronger on\r\n    the bike. So that's encouraging. I'm down from ~205# to reliably\r\n    under ~195#, and I'd love to get back down under 180#, where I was\r\n    in April of 2019. I felt <em>great</em> back then, and wasn't\r\n    strugling or pushing myself to maintain that.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "intro": "<p> Races 4-8 were a steady progression of feeling stronger &amp;\r\n    getting better results. Each week I did better &amp; better,\r\n    climbing from 18th to 13th, which is <em>great</em>. I only placed\r\n    16th overall, but that's to be expected when I spent the middle of\r\n    the series finishing around 20th each week.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> 8 individual races kind of blur together, but I <em>did</em> learn\r\n    plenty during this time.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Initially, I was soft-pedaling into spots where I knew there would\r\n    be an accordion effect, thinking that I was saving energy. \"We're\r\n    all gonna be wheel-to-wheel in a second anyway,\" I'd think. And\r\n    then three riders would dive in ahead of me, which would hold me\r\n    up and/or push me off the fast line, and I'd come out the other\r\n    end of the accordion having surrendered 5 positions.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> In later races, I reframed the typical rhythm of open trail\r\n    punctuated by tight turns or bottlenecks. I relized that in a 40-\r\n    to 60-minute race, it's a sprint from start to finish. Saving\r\n    energy is <em>nice</em>, but you've gotta do\r\n    it <em>opportunistically</em> rather than <em>tactically</em>.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Meaning: <em>if</em> someone is going a little faster than\r\n    you, <em>and</em> you can draft, then draft. But it's\r\n    almost <em>never</em> a good call to draft behind someone slower than\r\n    you in hopes of \"resting\" or \"recovering\".\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I worked on my cornering, and discovered that (possibly because of\r\n    the current state of my skills) I'm <em>far</em> smoother carrying\r\n    speed through corners if I <em>stand</em>.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> And I found that I can totally stand &amp; power up climbs &amp;\r\n    pass people, and that this works <em>much</em> better for me than\r\n    trying to sit &amp; spin.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Between standing for power and standing through corners, my\r\n    approach to most of this race <em>completely</em> changed. I'd\r\n    brake late, carry speed through the corner (leaning the bike as\r\n    much as possible for more grip), then stay standing &amp; power\r\n    out, rinse &amp; repeat.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> And honestly, I think pushing myself each week did great things\r\n    for my fitness. Not only was I <em>performing</em> better each\r\n    week, I <em>felt</em> better after the race.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I haven't seen my heart rate hit 185 BPM in a <em>long</em> time,\r\n    but it did duringing these races.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Take-Aways</h2>\r\n\r\n<p> Most of what I learned from the <a href=\"archive/3398\">2019 Over\r\n        the Hump series</a> served me well. A few additions:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Pass when you can:</b> the twists &amp; turns of this race\r\n    offer little windows where passing is possible. Make the most of\r\n    those opportunities. Pass, then use the course to defend your\r\n    position &amp; recoup for a few seconds, then go again.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Foam rolling:</b> foam rolling is <b>amazing</b> and completely\r\n    eliminated any need for Sudafed/NyQuil after races. Never even\r\n    thought to reach for them.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Base layer:</b> I have a\r\n    few <a href=\"https://www.pearlizumi.com/US/en/shop/men/baselayers/road/transfer_mesh_sleeveless_baselayer/p/11122106\">sleeveless\r\n        base layer tops</a>, and I'm now <em>religious</em> about wearing\r\n    them. Even on the hottest days on the race course, I felt like my\r\n    sweat was <em>actually cooling me</em> rather than just dripping off\r\n    or evaporating uselessly.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Bike fit:</b> after getting frustrated with lingering saddle\r\n    sores, I got a fit from <a href=\"http://boscobikefits.com/\">Bosco\r\n    Bike Fits</a>, and it was money <em>well</em> spent. My sores\r\n    disappeared as if they never existed, and have not returned.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Roctane Recovery Mix:</b> It's not cheap, but I really do love\r\n    it. Fantastic recharge after hard workouts. I ran out during the\r\n    last couple of races, and replaced it with a simple mix of protein\r\n    powder, milk, and chocolate syrup, and that seemed to get the job\r\n    done well enough.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n",

That prompted\r\n    some <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DeathB4Decaf/status/1422813392042090497\">re-evaluation</a>\r\n    of my goals and some investigation into how I slid 12 places in 15\r\n    days. The nutshell: a bunch of stronger riders either showed up,\r\n    or moved into Intermediate from other divisions.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> So, rather than looking at results, I looked at my time relative\r\n    to a rider who consistently finishes in the top 3 to get a sense\r\n    of how I was doing.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> In the first race, I finished ~1:30 behind him. In the second, I\r\n    was ~3:30 back. In the third, I was a miserable 4:40 off the pace.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> So, <em>both</em> things are true:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li> Riders stronger than me have joined my class\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li> I wasn't racing as well week-over-week.\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p> After race #3, I had a couple of take-aways.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> It is <em>immensely</em> clear that my trail skills have\r\n    atrophied. I'm not <em>nearly</em> as comfortable on trails as I\r\n    used to be, especially if they're loose. During races, I can feel\r\n    the extra effort taking its toll.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> The little, punchy climbs that litter the OtH courses were killing\r\n    me. I needed to get used to holding pace while periodically\r\n    pushing over short rises.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I'd also been following my TrainerRoad training plan, which\r\n    prescribed mostly rest between races, with an \"openers\" workout\r\n    the day before each race. I wondered how doing actual training\r\n    between races would affect my performance. (Both in terms of race\r\n    results, and whether I'd improve week-to-week.)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> So before race #4, I did some training rides during the week, and\r\n    moved them from power-based interval workouts done mostly on flats\r\n    to more race-specific stuff on trails.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> And honestly, that seemed to help a bit. For Race #4, I\r\n    was <em>much</em> better able to deal with the short rises.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Race #4 was honestly pretty uneventful. I was able to match my PR on\r\n    the <a href=\"https://www.strava.com/segments/654882?filter=overall\">back\r\n        lot climb</a>, which makes me happy, and I felt like I improved\r\n    the way I'm riding the first ~10 minutes of the race: didn't\r\n    overcook the start, maintained position well, and got onto the\r\n    flats with my HR at ~165 BPM, which is <em>exactly</em> where I\r\n    want to be.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I fumbled at least one place right at the end by not following\r\n    through over the top of the final climb. I had a gap on the rider\r\n    behind me, and I'd have kept it if I just pushed for another 5\r\n    seconds & gotten up to speed heading into the final 2:00 of the\r\n    race. I got passed with ~1:00 left to go, and that's entirely my\r\n    own doing. I did manage to <em>barely</em> hold off an attempt to\r\n    get past me right at the line.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> So, 4 races in, it's clear I've gotta work on three things, and\r\n    they're not subtle.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> First, I need to work on my cornering. I'm just bleeding time on\r\n    every single corner, and I absolutely <em>hate</em> my lack of\r\n    confidence in the turns. It's costing me time <em>and</em> fun.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Second, I'm going to do some YouTube research and see how faster,\r\n    more experienced racers deal with short rises. (~5 seconds)\r\n    There's a definite art to carrying momentum &amp; using minimal\r\n    energy to maintain/regain speed.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> And third, I simply have to get <em>faster</em>. When I was 1:25\r\n    off the lead, I felt like better skills &amp; tactics might close\r\n    the gap. But I'm 4:00+ back now, and that's down to my legs. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> And finally, I have to accept that if I'm going to win in\r\n    Intermediate, let alone move up to Sport &amp; be competitive\r\n    there, I'm going to have to get leaner. So I'm working on that. \r\n</p>\r\n",

    "intro": "<p> After nearly two years, the Over the Hump Tuesday-night races are\r\n    back on the calendar. Instead of two six-week blocks with a hiatus\r\n    in between, it's a single eight-week series. I'd <em>love</em> to\r\n    see more racing, and a longer season, but after 22 months of\r\n    waiting, I'll take what I can get.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> My goals were super-simple: stay with the leaders as long as I\r\n    could, and race smart. I've been watching\r\n    a <em>lot</em> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIfRR1N2Gm1vjj9X955iWSQ\">race\r\n    tactics videos</a> on YouTube this year, so I like to think I'm a\r\n    smarter racer than I was two years ago.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Because of some delays at the venue, organizers shortened the race\r\n    from three laps to two, which I was slightly bummed about. The\r\n    last lap is usually where I'm able to pick up a few places. And a\r\n    short race means a brutal pace I wasn't sure I could hang with.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I got off the line clean, and everyone seemed to take their time\r\n    getting up to speed. I was with the leaders into the first turn,\r\n    and felt really solid. As we crested the top of the hill & headed\r\n    down to the road along Irvine Lake, gaps were forming and I was\r\n    crosseyed, but I had the leaders in sight & felt okay about my\r\n    position.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I did my best to breathe &amp; conserve energy on the flats, but\r\n    the pace was still <em>super</em>-high, and as we came through the\r\n    park &amp; onto the \"back 40\" section, I'd been gapped pretty\r\n    good. I figured with just two laps in the race this was the best\r\n    time to do whatever passing I was going to manage, and started to\r\n    work my way up through the traffic.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> It was <em>amazing</em> to push along the flats solo at 280W, then\r\n    tuck in behind someone and watch that number drop to 170W without\r\n    losing <em>any</em> speed. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> The flat finished with that hard left up the nose &amp; into the\r\n    CX section. I decided not to burn my matches there, and I feel\r\n    like that's the smart move there. It's maybe a 30-second climb, so\r\n    going into the red just gains you <em>maybe</em> 5 seconds, which\r\n    can be made up with minimal fuss later. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> My trail skills are rusty after so much fire road riding in my\r\n    training, and the course was really loose &amp; dusty. So I feel\r\n    like the back section took more out of me than it should have. (Or\r\n    at least, more than it used to.) \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I headed into lap 2 with no clue what position I was in. I just\r\n    tried to remind myself that there was no point saving any matches,\r\n    and that I really had maybe 15 minutes of racing left. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I managed to pick up a place coming through the park, and as I\r\n    headed into the \"Back 40\", I spotted a huge train motoring along\r\n    about 40m ahead. I've learned my lesson from so many crit videos,\r\n    and I know that I've gotta catch that.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> So catch it I did. I kept myself just shy of redlining, but\r\n    managed to join the back of that train &amp; get into that sweet,\r\n    sweet suction. I took a minute to rest, but realized that I had\r\n    one competitor just ahead, and another behind. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> The train started to split apart, so I jumped on my competitor's\r\n    wheel &amp; went with him for the rest of the flat section. A\r\n    glance back showed a nice gap, so I stopped looking for the guy\r\n    behind, and just focused on moving up.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> The guy I was following attacked up the nose climb, and I just\r\n    couldn't go. I hoped that if I could stay in striking distance I\r\n    could make up the time later in the lap, but after that he\r\n    was <em>gone</em>.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I had a nice gap after the final climb, but didn't want to take\r\n    that for granted. And I'm glad I didn't. A guy in my division\r\n    wearing all black managed to sneak up &amp; passed me going into\r\n    the second-to-last corner. <em>Very</em> fortunately, there was a\r\n    guy in another division just ahead of us and we all hit that\r\n    corner at the same time. Mr. All-Black was forced to\r\n    go <em>outside</em> of the other guy, but I had space to\r\n    pull <em>inside</em> &amp; get past them both. I spun up the hill\r\n    as fast as I could &amp; held on for 9th place. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> (My GPS says I hit 130+ RPM there, which seems unlikely, but\r\n    matches my experience at the time of just spinning as fast as I\r\n    could.)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I had high hopes for this race. I spent several months at the\r\n    beginning of 2020 <a href=\"archive/3402\">building muscle</a>, and\r\n    I've been pushing hard on the bike to build my fitness.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Unfortunately, it looks like I've mostly just <em>maintained</em>,\r\n    rather than improved. That's... disappointing.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> On the other hand, I'll get to do <em>eight</em> races this year\r\n    instead of just four back in 2019, and I\r\n    improved <em>significantly</em> during those four races back\r\n    then. I'm hoping I can do likewise this year.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> So, goals for next week:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li> start harder- stay with the <em>leaders</em>. I'm not 100%\r\n        convinced this will get me my best possible results, but I\r\n        really do feel like at this race the top finishers pull away\r\n        quickly &amp; stay away.\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li> more burning matches, more coasting. I spent a <em>lot</em>\r\n        of time just above FTP, and that meant I had nothing when I\r\n        needed to push harder. I want to see what happens when I, for\r\n        example, start hard, then coast &amp; draft along the flats,\r\n        then attack up the nose, then recover in the CX section, then\r\n        attack up the longer climb, then coast through the\r\n        start/finish, etc. Might be a terrible idea. Dunno. I want to\r\n        find out.\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>",

    "intro": "<h3>Upgrades!</h3>\r\n\r\n<p> First, I got a Stages left-crank power meter for my mountain\r\n    bike. The change has been <em>phenomenal</em>. Instant feedback on\r\n    technique means I'm really focusing on getting <em>faster</em>\r\n    rather than just building aerobic capacity as a proxy for power\r\n    output.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> That set the stage for joining TrainerRoad's training program. So\r\n    far, that's been awesome. I'm <em>clearly</em> getting much\r\n    stronger & faster, and I like the variety it provides over\r\n    something like <em>Time-Crunched Training Protocol</em>. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> And I've upgraded GPS unit, replacing my old Garmin Edge 500 with\r\n    a new Edge 130 Plus. Wireless sync has been awesome, and the\r\n    screen is <em>so</em> much clearer. Both units support structured\r\n    workout downloads from TrainierRoad, but the workout screen on the\r\n    130 Plus is <em>so</em> much better than what's available on the\r\n    500.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I also decided to try using a base layer just for grins, and I'll\r\n    never go back to just a jersey. I'm using a Pearl Izumi sleeveless\r\n    mesh base layer, and it keeps the chilly days from\r\n    being <em>too</em> chilly, and noticeably helps make hot days\r\n    manageable as well.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Saddle Sores</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p> I've never had trouble with saddles before this year. But now... I\r\n    do.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I suspect that the biggest reason is that I've been\r\n    doing <em>much</em> more training (indeed, <em>most</em> of my\r\n    training) on flat fire roads along the Santa Anna River Trail. On\r\n    trails (where I did most of my riding until now), there's much\r\n    more weighting & unweighting the saddle, shifting positions, etc.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Whatever the reason, saddle sores have been a persistent problem\r\n    for me for the last few months. So far, I've been lucky. They\r\n    haven't caused any disruption in my training or gotten beyond\r\n    merely annoying. But they're not going away, and I want to get\r\n    that resolved <em>before</em> it becomes a real problem.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> On the calendar, the next two weeks are rest & prep for a race in\r\n    Big Bear followed by a recovery week. So the plan is already\r\n    calling for very little time on the bike with lots of rest, and\r\n    workouts to maintain fitness rather than build it.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I won't be doing the Big Bear race, so I'm going to take advantage\r\n    of that low volume to get some extra rest &amp; minimize my time\r\n    in the saddle. I'm hoping that doing just 2-3hrs over the next\r\n    couple of weeks will let my sores heal completely.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I've also ordered a new seatpost that will give me more fine-tuned\r\n    tilt & setback options, and I have a new saddle with a slightly\r\n    wider body & more padding that I <em>hope</em> will help spread\r\n    some of the pressure & minimize hip rocking.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> And finally, once I'm healed I'm going to book a bike fit\r\n    at <a href=\"http://boscobikefits.com/\">Bosco Bike Fits</a> to get\r\n    my bike fit nailed down properly. I've never had a proper bike\r\n    fit, and I like to think that if I had, I'd wouldn't be dealing\r\n    with this now.\r\n</p>\r\n",

    "intro": "<p> I've plotted a rough training outline for 2021, with the <em>Over\r\n    the Hump</em> races as B races, and some more classic style race\r\n    series on the radar as possibilities for A races if/when racing\r\n    resumes.\r\n</p>\r\n    \r\n<p> My goal for 2021 is to get on the podium as\r\n    an <em>Intermediate</em> racer, and set the stage for a move up\r\n    to <em>Sport</em> in 2022.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> For now, I'm using Strava's workouts (based on\r\n    Charmichael's <em>Time-Crunched Training Protocol</em>), and\r\n    making solid progress. Two-hour rides at 140 BPM feel easy, 150\r\n    BPM feels normal, and I'm doing intervals at 155-165 BPM to push\r\n    my FTP up. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> It's been a <em>long</em> time since I did real climbing repeats\r\n    at 170+ BPM, so my climbing is garbage at the moment.

But I feel like the time I\r\n    spend in my so-called <a href=\"archive/3405\">strength build</a>\r\n    was mostly <em>maintaining</em>, rather than <em>building</em>. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I got my game together during the quarantine, and pushed my bench\r\n    press, deadlift, and squat strength <em>way</em> up. I hit numbers\r\n    that mark excellent progress, and that I can live with for\r\n    now. I'll head back into a hypertrophy block in October-December\r\n    (might as well put those holiday calories to work...), and build\r\n    on that success.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Bike Performance</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I explicitly set out my goal to <em>play the long game</em>, to\r\n    work steadily toward my long-term goals, even at the expense of\r\n    short-term gains. For me, that means steadily working\r\n    toward <a href=\"archive/3405\">strength</a> and body composition\r\n    benchmarks first. It's increasingly clear that those are table\r\n    stakes for success in local races.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> With the 2020 OtH series first postponed, then postponed again, I\r\n    pretty quickly saw which way the wind was blowing and wrote off this\r\n    summer entirely. That, together with the shelter-in-place orders, made\r\n    strength work the clear best way to spend my training time between\r\n    March and July. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> So I'm not too concerned with my on-bike performance. I'm not as\r\n    quick as I was this time last year, but I'm <em>almost</em> as\r\n    quick on short climbs, and I know from experience that I can\r\n    extend that to build more endurance &amp; repeatability. I'm doing\r\n    a good job of maintaining a base of cardio/endurance fitness.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> What data I do have on my bike tells me that I'm pretty much on\r\n    par with where my training rides were this time last year. Given\r\n    the great progress I've made building strength in the last 8\r\n    months, I call that a win.\r\n</p>\r\n"

So\r\n    I'm going to keep doing that, and I'm going to keep writing about\r\n    it here.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> The <a href=\"http://raceoc.com\">Over the Hump</a> schedule was\r\n    first pushed to May 19, and is now listed as July 21, but I'm\r\n    writing off my 2020 race season. I think of it as playing the long\r\n    game. Instead of focusing on getting race-ready for 2020, I've\r\n    taken a step back from riding and instead spent some time on\r\n    barbell work to build a generally stronger, more capable body.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Goals</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I've cobbled together my long-term strength goals\r\n    from <a href=\"https://www.mensjournal.com/features/everything-you-know-about-fitness-is-a-lie-20120504/\">articles</a>,\r\n    <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Cyclists-Training-Bible-Joe-Friel/dp/1934030201\">books</a>,\r\n    <a href=\"https://www.trainerroad.com/blog/coach-chads-strength-training-recommendations-for-cyclists/\">blog\r\n    posts</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YOD1yXdOhE&t=142s\">YouTube\r\n    videos</a>, and my own experience.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<table border=\"1\">\r\n    <tr>\r\n        <th>&nbsp;</th>\r\n        <th>goal</th>\r\n        <th>current</th>\r\n    </tr>\r\n    <tr>\r\n        <th>squat</th>\r\n        <td>1.5 x BW (270#)</td>\r\n        <td>195#</td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n    <tr>\r\n        <th>deadlift</th>\r\n        <td>2.0 x BW (360#)</td>\r\n        <td>245#</td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n    <tr>\r\n        <th>bench press</th>\r\n        <td>1.5 x BW (270#)</td>\r\n        <td>140#</td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n    <tr>\r\n        <th>pull-up</th>\r\n        <td>10 @ BW</td>\r\n        <td>4 @ BW</td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Methods</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I've taken a step back from bike-focused training, and centered my\r\n    training around body composition and building strength &amp;\r\n    muscle mass. I've been down this road before,\r\n    with <a href=\"archive/3304\">disappointing results</a>, so this is\r\n    something of a leap of faith. But, I've made a couple of key\r\n    choices this time around that have really helped.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> First, I've stuck to the basics, and added <b>one</b>\r\n    complementary movement where I felt it was appropriate.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Second, I've ruthlessly avoided changing too much over time. I\r\n    want a solid framework within which I can apply progressive\r\n    overload to make my body stronger.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Third, I've tailored <em>one</em> workout a week to addressing\r\n    general mobility &amp; core strength, with some emphasis on a\r\n    couple of problem areas.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> It's <em>really</em> tempting to add too much. But I find that\r\n    most of these workouts clock in at around 1:15h, and on the hard\r\n    days they leave me wobbly. That tells me I'm doing enough.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Workouts</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> The primary goal is to build strength, and not necessarily to\r\n    build muscle mass. (I covered hypertrophy back\r\n    in <a href=\"archive/3405\">late 2019</a>.)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> For the primary movements (bench, pull-up, squat, deadlift), I've\r\n    taken a note from <a href=\"archive/3402\">Mass Made Simple</a> and\r\n    adopted a cycle of set/rep/load that seems to be working well:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n    <li> Workout #1: 3 x 5, 2 min rest between sets\r\n    </li>\r\n    \r\n    <li> Workout #2: 5 x 5, 90 sec rest between sets\r\n    </li>\r\n    \r\n    <li> Workout #3: 3 x 8, 2 min reset between sets\r\n    </li>\r\n\r\n    <li> Increse the load &amp; repeat the cycle.\r\n    </li>\r\n</ol>\r\n \r\n<p> Basically, start by doing enough volume to get used to the load\r\n    &amp; trigger some growth. Then push up the volume, and finally,\r\n    consolidate the reps back into 3 sets to push the growth further.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> That's working well. While I was doing Mass Made Simple, my bench\r\n    press max double was 135. I can now do that for 5 x 5.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Lower Body/Back (Wednesdays)</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li> deadlift (3x5 | 5x5 | 3x8)\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li> squat (3x5 | 5x5 | 3x8)\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li> crab walk 3 x 45/60\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li> kb snatch 3 x 20\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Upper Body (Mondays &amp; Fridays)</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li> bench press (3x5 | 5x5 | 3x8)\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li> pull-up (3x5 | 5x5 | 3x8)\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li> face pull 3 x 10\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li> front raise 3 x 10\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li> barbell complex (5x5 | 3x8):\r\n        <ul>\r\n            <li> bent row\r\n            </li>\r\n            <li> deadlift\r\n            </li>\r\n            <li> power clean\r\n            </li>\r\n            <li> military press\r\n            </li>\r\n            <li> squat\r\n            </li>\r\n            <li> Romanian deadlift\r\n            </li>\r\n        </ul>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Complementary Work (Saturday)</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li> circuit x 3:\r\n        <ul>\r\n            <li> back extension\r\n            </li>\r\n            <li> axe chop\r\n            </li>\r\n            <li> Jefferson curl\r\n            </li>\r\n            <li> hanging knee raise\r\n            </li>\r\n        </ul>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li> <a href=\"archive/2889\">stretching</a>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Random Notes</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I feel like the <b>crab walks</b> (which I do more in an ice\r\n    skating motion due to space constraints) have been a fantastic\r\n    addition to my workouts. I decided to try that after seeing that\r\n    it was part\r\n    of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJl_xKJ54Xk&t=237s\">Emily\r\n    Batty's</a> gym program.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> And the day of core strength &amp; hip mobility has been great. I\r\n    added the back extensions after\r\n    watching <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOJu7xi3l3Q\">Jeff\r\n    Cavaliere</a> talk about how just doing squats &amp; deadlifts\r\n    is <em>not</em> enough to really build a strong low back.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Together, the crab walks, back extensions, axe chops, and mobilty\r\n    work has <em>massively</em> improved how I feel on standing\r\n    climbs, and improved how my low back feels after tough/long rides.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I find it interesting to note that this has been more effective\r\n    even than\r\n    the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BOTvaRaDjI\">Foundation\r\n    Training low back</a> sequence. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Preliminary Results</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> My measurements are virtually identical to when I finished\r\n    my <a href=\"archive/3402\">hypertrophy block</a> back in November,\r\n    which is great. I'm not trying to add bulk, and I'm not adding\r\n    fat.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I'm comitted to \"playing the long game\", which means moving\r\n    consistently toward those strength targets, and genuinely letting\r\n    go of 2020 and aiming to hit next summer in the best cycling shape\r\n    of my life.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Just the same, I was worried what several months of prioritizing\r\n    strength work would do. Nobody likes to move backward. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> So after taking a rest week and doing a couple of rides to wake up\r\n    my legs, I did a ride\r\n    up <a href=\"https://www.strava.com/segments/7617104\">Coachwhip</a>\r\n    to see where I stand.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Result: I hit my fastest time in nearly a year. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> That's still ~80 seconds off PR pace, but I'm no longer worried\r\n    about losing huge levels of hard-earned bike fitness. I'm\r\n    confident that prioritizing strength over the last few months is\r\n    paying dividends, and I'm on the right track for a great 2021 race\r\n    season.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>What's Next</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> During my late-2019 <a href=\"archive/3402\">hypertrophy block</a>,\r\n    I gained ~10# of muscle. I'd like to now <em>shed</em> ~10# of\r\n    fat, so that I'm back at my 2019 body mass with a much-improved\r\n    composition, and <em>massively</em> better strength. That'll take\r\n    up July &amp; August, and maybe a couple weeks of September.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> And I'm reading up on targeting slow-twitch hypertrophy, so that\r\n    may be on deck for September/October.\r\n</p>\r\n",

    "intro": "<p> The single best thing I've done for my training this year is to\r\n    build a periodized plan that clarifies priorities, and\r\n    then <em>stick to those priorities</em>. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> And so, here I am reminding myself of my initial principles:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li> clear priorities\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li> play the long game\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p> I've been putting off my fat-loss &amp; base training block. The\r\n    plan is to do what I did last year: shed ~10 lbs by simply\r\n    postponing breakfast until after my 11:00 AM bike ride. Basically,\r\n    I did fasted cardio, and it worked great.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I've been hesitating to implement this because:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n    <li> I like breakfast.\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li> I've given myself the excuse that I need the fuel to make\r\n        sure my rides are productive.\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li> I only have ~12 weeks until my first race. I don't want to\r\n        sacrifice training efficacy to gain weight loss.\r\n    </li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p> This is bullshit. I'm doing some difficult intervals, sure. But\r\n    they're not <em>intense</em> intervals. They're right around my\r\n    lactate threshold. So I don't <em>need</em> the available glucose.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> This week is a back-off week, so I'll let it go. But when I start\r\n    back up next week, it's time to get real about dropping the fat.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I have to remember that it may be 11 weeks until\r\n    the <em>first</em> 6-race OtH series starts, but it's ~22 weeks\r\n    until the <em>second</em> series starts. Fat loss should go early\r\n    in my training (in other words: <em>now</em>). And if I put it off\r\n    until later, I'll just sabotage <em>both</em> series for\r\n    myself. Far, far better to <em>Play the Long Game</em> and focus\r\n    on the genuine top priority in the here-and-now: drop 10 lbs of\r\n    dead weight.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "intro": "<p> I'm cutting the last week of my planned strength block. My right\r\n    AC joint has been hurting, and I want to focus on getting it\r\n    healed & strong again. I <em>think</em> I tweaked it doing bench\r\n    presses during my hypertrophy block. It's mostly been fine since\r\n    then, but it's been hurting this week and I <em>really</em> want\r\n    it to be solid by the time I start racing.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> So, I feel like that's a solid decision. It's a good time to\r\n    switch my focus to on-bike gains, and put the barbell stuff into\r\n    maintenance/prehab mode.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> But I didn't feel good ending the block on that note... until I\r\n    started looking at the numbers.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n",

I've managed to trim down a bit\r\n    without losing the mass I built during the hypertrophy block. My\r\n    waist got trimmer, I dropped ~4#, and everything else got\r\n    stronger.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Strength</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I feel a bit silly, but I managed to put together a workout that\r\n    made it pretty difficult to quantify progress.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I pushed my deadlift from 165# to 235#. That's pretty clear. But\r\n    box jumps and pull-ups are harder.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I can <em>feel</em> how much stronger the box jumps are. I don't\r\n    have a proper plyo box, so I'm jumping onto a 16'' bench. However,\r\n    over the course of the last 6 weeks, I've jumped from farther and\r\n    farther away onto the bench, and felt stronger and stronger doing\r\n    it.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> And the barbell complex I've been doing now feels like a warm-up\r\n    at 85#. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Ditto for planks, farmer walks, and Jefferson curls. The objective\r\n    loads haven't changed, but the RPE has gotten steadily easier.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> So, I <em>feel</em> really good about the progress I've made, even\r\n    if I can't really quaitify it. The proof will be in how the\r\n    on-bike training shakes out.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> When I started this block, I was noticing a lot of fatigue & some\r\n    discomfort in my low back, and that's now completely gone. (I\r\n    credit the Jefferson curls &amp; farmer walks.)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> And my body weight has dropped from 198# to 194#, so I'm down four\r\n    pounds in 6 weeks, which is <em>fine</em>. (I'm watching my waist\r\n    measurement <em>and</em> my weight, so as long as I'm getting\r\n    leaner, I can deal with the number on the scale not being what I\r\n    planned on.)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Nutrition</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I did <em>not</em> supplement with protein for this block. I added\r\n    more fat than I wanted during\r\n    the <a href=\"archive/3402\">hypertrophy block</a>, and I that got\r\n    in my head a bit. I probably traded some strength gains to get\r\n    leaner, but the strength gains I <em>did</em> make were plenty.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Aside from that, I just kept to my normal diet: minimal sugar,\r\n    protein at breakfast, etc.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Long-Term Goals</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <em>The Cyclist's Training Bible</em> lists target loads for some\r\n    fundamental exercises as a guage of progress:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li> squat: 1.3 - 1.7 x BW\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li> leg press: 2.5 - 2.9 x BW\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li> step-up: 0.7 - 0.9 x BW\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li> seated row: 0.5 - 0.8 x BW\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li> standing row: 0.4 - 0.7 x BW\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p> At the moment, I'm well below those targets. So I've got something\r\n    to shoot for.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n"

    "intro": "<p> With my <a href=\"archive/3402\">hypertrophy block</a> successful,\r\n    the next step is to build on that foundation. Next up is an 9-week\r\n    strength-building block.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I've avoided the temptation to throw in everything. \"Enough\" upper\r\n    body work really is <em>enough</em>. And I'll be\r\n    geting <em>plenty</em> of bike-specific work <em>on my\r\n    bike</em>.

First workout was tough, second felt solid, so I\r\n    increased the weight for the third, and I feel it just right in my\r\n    hips & hams.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I'm doing the barbell work Monday &amp; Thursday, and doing easy\r\n    loops on the bike on Tuesday &amp; Friday. So far, that's working\r\n    well. The bike rides are feeling better and better, and so are the\r\n    barbell sessions, so... success? Or am I just not going hard\r\n    enough in the gym? Dunno. I'll just track my progress and tweak as\r\n    I go.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>The Mental Aspect</h3>\r\n\r\n<p> I took a lot of comfort in doing the <em>Mass Made Simple</em>\r\n    program, because basically none of the decision-making was up to\r\n    me. I could see &amp; feel myself getting stronger, and all I had\r\n    to do was stick with the program.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Putting together my own strength program is far less comfortable.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Honestly, I'm a little stressed at being nearly 20# heavier than I\r\n    was at this time last year, with ~3 monts <em>less</em> time than\r\n    last year before racing starts. That really seems... not good.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> But looking at the calendar, I'm <em>fine</em>. I've got plenty of\r\n    time. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Looking at my records from last year has helped. It really only\r\n    took me about 8 weeks to drop 10#, and if I do that again this\r\n    year, I'll be happy. That would take me back to my racing weight\r\n    last year, with significantly more muscle.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I've backed <em>way</em> off on the protein intake. I've bulked up\r\n    plenty, and I know from experience that I don't need that kind of\r\n    calorie/protein intake to build strength. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>The Big Picture</h3>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li> Priorities, in order:\r\n        <ul>\r\n            <li> gain strength\r\n            </li>\r\n            <li> don't gain any more weight\r\n            </li>\r\n            <li> stretch goal: shed fat\r\n            </li>\r\n        </ul>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li> Barbell Mon/Thr, bike Tue/Fri.\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li> Weigh-in every Friday, with the goal being not\r\n        to <em>gain</em> much. \r\n    </li>\r\n    <li> If I'm not recovered for my barbell work, I'll cut\r\n        intensity/volume on the bike. For now, strenght work takes\r\n        priority.\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p> And with a plan in place, I do feel better. We'll see where I am\r\n    in 8 weeks.\r\n</p>\r\n",

    "intro": "<h3>The Program</h3>\r\n    \r\n<p> I mostly followed Dan\r\n    John's <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Mass-Made-Simple-Dan-John-ebook/dp/B006HXPR66/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1573691993&sr=8-1\">Mass\r\n    Made Simple</a>, but I'll state up front that I <b>did not do the\r\n    program as written</b>. In particular:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li> I started the program, completed 3 workouts, then got sick &\r\n        continued to do the third workout as a holding pattern until I\r\n        felt solid enough to move forward.\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li> The program recommends a three-day workout rhythm. (Each\r\n        workout is followed by exactly two rest/recharge days.) I\r\n        worked out twice a week.

    "body": "<h3>Nutrition</h3>\r\n\r\n<p> I decided to mostly stay off the bike during this block. I wanted\r\n    a break after finishing the local race season, and I found that\r\n    the barbell workouts maxed out my recovery capacity anyway. From a\r\n    purely caloric perspective, the fuel that I was no longer burning\r\n    on the bike was plenty to let me grow some muscle.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Aside from that, I've eliminated sweets from my diet and breakfast\r\n    usually consists of two boiled egg whites and a high-fiber cereal.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Supplements</h3>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Protein:</b> I added 90g of protein to my diet each day. I'd\r\n    have a protein shake with lunch (30g), and one after dinner (60g).\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Here's the recipe:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li> 1 cup almond milk\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li> 1 scoop (30g) protein powder (2 scoops at night)\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li> 1 spoonful of smooth peanut butter\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li> 1 squeeze Hershey's syrup (~2tbsp)\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li> 1 banana\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li> 6 ice cubes\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Creatine:</b> I followed Mass Made Simple's recommendation to\r\n    supplement with ~5g of creatine each day during the program. I\r\n    took it all at once in tablet form with my nightly protein shake,\r\n    and I've experienced no ill effects, and it seems to help with\r\n    recovery between sets, and my ability to do longer sets.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Fish Oil:</b> I continued my normal routine of taking a\r\n    multivitamin tablet and several capsules of fish oil with dinner\r\n    every night.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Subjective Notes</h3>\r\n\r\n<p> I can absolutely feel that I'm stronger than when I started, and\r\n    comparing workouts from the beginning &amp; end of the program\r\n    bears that out.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> During the last two weeks of the program, I <em>definitely</em>\r\n    felt the fatigue accumulating. Once again, it's clear that adequte\r\n    sleep is absolutely key for me. If I slept well, I'd feel good\r\n    about recovering &amp; finishing out the program. If I didn't\r\n    sleep enough (late night, work, dad life), I found my motivation\r\n    &amp; recovery both flagging.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> During the first half of the program, I was drinking 2 protein\r\n    shakes a day, for a total of 60g of protein. That felt like\r\n    enough, but as the workouts got tougher, I started putting 60g of\r\n    protein in my nighttime shake after workouts, and that boosted my\r\n    recovery &amp; muscle gain.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I intentionally did <em>not</em> track my measurements during the\r\n    program, mostly because I didn't want to overthink it. I wanted to\r\n    just do the program as written (as much as possible), and see\r\n    where I ended up. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> As the squats got heavier, I really did feel my posterior chain\r\n    start to work as a single unit. I feel like that's a nice\r\n    progression from the very quad-dominant squat form I had in the\r\n    past.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Before the beginning of the program, I'd been feeling some extra\r\n    fatigue in my low back, and I worried that the sheer volume of\r\n    squatting (and the loads) might be a Bad Idea for me. I maintained\r\n    squat form at all times, and I've felt my low back get\r\n    progressively stronger.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> If I do a similar training block next year, I'll refine my\r\n    nutrition a bit. Now that I know I can put on muscle, I'd like to\r\n    get to a position where I have less fat to shed going into the\r\n    season.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>Looking Ahead</h3>\r\n\r\n<p> In the past, I've made excellent progress in the weight room only\r\n    to find it tough to translate those gains to the bike. I'm going\r\n    to make sure I hold onto whatever gains in work capacity I've\r\n    earned over the last two months.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I've had good results in the past by shifting to a slightly taller\r\n    gear than what feels right. As my legs adapt, I shift again. I'm\r\n    hoping that training like that over the next few months will build\r\n    my ability to push taller gears &amp; move faster.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Whether I repeat this program next season will hinge both on my\r\n    race results and on my body composition when I get\r\n    there. Honestly, I feel like my squat & deadlift numbers are small\r\n    for my size, so I might be better off focusing on strength.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I honestly couldn't be happier with my results. I put on lots of\r\n    muscle & got much stronger. Last year at this time I weighed\r\n    ~186#, so I've got more fat to shed this year than last year. But\r\n    I'm fine with that. If I'm a few pounds heavier that last year,\r\n    pbut I'm a couple of percentage points leaner, I'm happy with\r\n    that.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Long Game Goals</h3>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Fat loss.</b>  I really want to get leaner. So the next\r\n    training block will <em>involve</em> getting my body used to\r\n    spending time on the bike again, but the primary goal will be to\r\n    shed fat.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Strength maintenance.</b> I've pushed up my numbers quite a\r\n    bit, so I want to keep them where they are &amp; <em>start</em> at\r\n    next season's training where I've <em>finished</em> this\r\n    season's. It would be awesome to be able to do this program 100%\r\n    as-written.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    "intro": "<p> I've had a cough for the last couple of weeks. I initially thought\r\n    it was nothing, and just kept training, which felt fine. But it\r\n    held on &amp; got worse rather than better, so I've just stopped\r\n    training altogether &amp; concentrated on getting the rest I\r\n    need.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I'm finally on the mend &amp; expect to be ready to hit the\r\n    weights again on Friday. But I don't want to just jump back in\r\n    where I left off, so I'll be repeating the second week of\r\n    <em>Mass Made Simple</em> before moving forward &amp; completing\r\n    the program.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> A week off, plus repeating a week means I'll be 2 weeks\r\n    behind. The initial plan was for 7 weeks of mass building, but the\r\n    extra two weeks pushes it to 9, and I'm not sure my body will want\r\n    to do that. So once I hit week #5 of the program (which will be\r\n    week #7 on the calendar) I'll be alert for signs of deeper\r\n    fatigue: lack of motivation, stalled progress, trouble sleeping.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Focusing on next summer has made it <em>much</em> easier to make\r\n    the right decisions this week. I feel like I have plenty of time\r\n    to rest &amp; recover and I'll still be able to bring my A game\r\n    when it matters.\r\n</p>\r\n",

    "intro": "<p> Even before the last race of the Over the Hump season, I could\r\n    feel that I needed a break. I was looking forward to being able to\r\n    just ride wherever I wanted, <em>if</em> I wanted. And finishing\r\n    5th in that last race, and 7th overall, really made me feel like\r\n    I'd done what I set out to do. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> So what now? Well, it's a good time to take a big-picture look at\r\n    my health &amp; fitness, and to play the game so that I arrive in\r\n    May 2020 stronger, fitter, faster and more injury-proof than I am\r\n    now.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I talked with a nutritionist, who said that I generally eat pretty\r\n    well, and suggested a few improvements to try. I'm trying them.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I've taken a rest week, and I'm now starting to do some light\r\n    barbell work to acclimate my body to that kind of work\r\n    again. (Mostly a modified version of Cosgrove's Evil 8, without\r\n    the power cleans or good mornings.)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I've started Dan\r\n    John's <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Mass-Made-Simple-Dan-John-ebook/dp/B006HXPR66\">Mass\r\n    Made Simple</a> program. It's classic \"bus bench\" stuff: show up,\r\n    do the workout, enjoy the results. The core of the workout is a\r\n    barbell complex (row, clean, front squat, press, back squat, good\r\n    morning) similar to Cosgrove's Evil 8, and a heavy helping of\r\n    squats.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> The first workout went really well, and today I'm definitely sore,\r\n    but not hurting. (I went slightly easy on the complex to make sure\r\n    I had the gas for the squats.) I'll up the weight a bit on the\r\n    complex next time.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> And honestly, I think just a 40-minute complex/squats/pull-up\r\n    workout will be an <em>excellent</em> way to maintain my strength\r\n    gains once I get back on the bike &amp; start base building again\r\n    in a couple of months.\r\n</p>\r\n",

    "intro": "<p> My final race of the Over the Hump season went <em>really</em>\r\n    well. I managed to hit my personal goal of a top-5 finish, and\r\n    racked up enough points to place 7th overall. I'm\r\n    really happy with that.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> The race this week got off to a much cleaner start than last week,\r\n    though I had to make my way around a guy who lined up on the front\r\n    row, but didn't seem to have the gas to stay near the front at the\r\n    start. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> In the meantime, half a dozen riders had come around me, so I set\r\n    about <em>not</em> burning all my matches on the first punchy\r\n    rise, and making the most of the flat along the lake. I found a\r\n    train &amp; jumped on, and was content to get pulled along, and\r\n    could see that we were passing others in my division. When I did\r\n    pull through, I just kept the same pace &amp; tried to bring the\r\n    rest of the train with me, but it broke apart and I found myself\r\n    alone again on the CX section, which was fine with me.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I grabbed another wheel through the second lap's flat section, and\r\n    actually felt like I'd recovered a bit going into the back half of\r\n    the race. I just concentrated on cornering well and carrying as\r\n    much speed as I could.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I came through the last lap feeling like I had a bit of a gap, but\r\n    knowing that I'd had just a few seconds at <em>best</em> in every\r\n    race so far. I wasn't about to let off the gas.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> The course doubled back on itself several times near the end of\r\n    the lap, so I could see that I had a little bit of a gap going\r\n    into the final 500m or so of the race. But I wasn't about to take\r\n    anything for granted. Nobody behind me for 30m or so was good, but\r\n    no guarantee of anything.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I pushed over the top of the last rise and tried to carry as much\r\n    speed as I could over the pump section. Coming out of the final,\r\n    loose, uphill right-hander before the finish I hit the\r\n    gas <em>hard</em>, and just tried to make sure I didn't give away\r\n    any opportunities at the last moment. If anyone was going to get\r\n    around me, I wanted to at least make them earn it. The only\r\n    thought in my head was, <em>Looking back just makes you slower!\r\n    GO!</em>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> The way things shook out, I earned an overall score I'm fine with,\r\n    hit my goal of a top-5 finish (which I thought wasn't going to\r\n    happen), and have a nice pint glass as a souvenir. That's a pretty\r\n    great way to finish out the season.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Next year, I'll aim to improve on that. But for now, I'm going to\r\n    rest up for a week or two, then hit the weights &amp; start laying\r\n    the groundwork for next year.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n",

    "intro": "<p> Life got in the way for a couple of weeks, and I missed races #9\r\n    and #10. So it was really fun to be back at the start line this week\r\n    for #11.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Another flat course, another super-fast start. The start was\r\n    hectic, and by the time the field settled I knew the leaders had\r\n    gapped everyone else, and I wasn't sure where I was sitting. So I\r\n    just tried to push and get clear. I've learned to just get away as\r\n    fast as I can without burning out the legs immediately, and that\r\n    worked out okay this week.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> The flat along the lake was early in the lap, and a few riders\r\n    came around me soon after that. (Either on the short, sharp climb\r\n    that ends the flat, or on the CX-style section that followed.) But\r\n    I was able to grab a wheel here and there and hold my pace, and\r\n    managed to pull back a few places on the second lap.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> By the time I hit the flat on the third lap, there was just one\r\n    competitor near me. He tried to pass on the sharp climb after the\r\n    flat, but I got ahead & built a lead on the CX section, and by the\r\n    time I was headed for the finish, I could see I had a comfortable\r\n    gap.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Just the same, I pushed hard through the last climbing S-turn to\r\n    the finish, not wanting a replay of race #7.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> There were <em>lots</em> of trains forming during this race for\r\n    some reason. (I think the course brought the Sport/Elite classes\r\n    together with the Beginner/Intermeditates more than usual.) I\r\n    ended up pulling a few for a while before realizing they were\r\n    behind me.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> So, if I have a note from this week, it's to look for trains to\r\n    jump onto on the flat. The two that I did manage to fall in wich\r\n    picked up my speed by ~2mph, which is a <em>huge</em> energy\r\n    advantage.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> So, ultimately, I had an okay start, held my pace, managed to pick\r\n    up a couple of spots on lap 2, and finished strong. Pretty good!\r\n</p>\r\n",

    "intro": "<p> Up 5 places! Quite an improvement over last week! \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Before the race, I scoped out the finish and made a mental note of\r\n    the beats: climb, coast, flat, hard left,\r\n    sprint. This <em>really</em> helped at the end of the race when I\r\n    was just about cooked, but knew I had to make the most of that\r\n    coasting section so I'd have something left to push across the\r\n    flat & sprint for the finish.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> The start was the usual drag race off the line, followed by a\r\n    steep, narrow ramp about 200m from the start that created enough\r\n    of a bottleneck that the first guys through basically got the hole\r\n    shot. I didn't get held up <em>too</em> bad, but I didn't exactly\r\n    roll through with any momentum.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> On the fire road climb I just tried to hold an aggressive pace and\r\n    stay with whomever I could, and I <em>especially</em> tried not to\r\n    let myself get stuck behind slower riders. If I could pass without\r\n    redlining, I did.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I think that helped my position going over the top, which ended up\r\n    being pretty close to my finishing place, I think. I have a pet\r\n    theory that if there's just one climb on a course, the order at\r\n    the top is generally the finishing order. That seems to have held\r\n    last night.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> As we started the second lap, I caught up to a competitor in blue,\r\n    and managed to grab onto his wheel.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> We rode like that for a while, then, on the flats headed for the\r\n    last climb, he let me pass and grabbed a wheel a couple of riders\r\n    behind me. I tried to lose him in traffic, but he held on, and\r\n    then made the decisive pass with about 20m left to go on the\r\n    climb. I had no answer, and had to let him go.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> As I was crossing the flat section leading to the finish line, I\r\n    spotted another competitor trying to sneak past, and gave it a bit\r\n    more gas. He was strong, but evidently not <em>quite</em> enough\r\n    to pass, so I was able to hold on for 7th.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> So what went well?\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I was in the right gear & clipped in clean off the starting line.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I was more aggressive about passing slower riders, which I think\r\n    both reduced drag <em>and</em> helped me keep a comfortable\r\n    rhythm.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I managed to mostly avoid getting passed on the last lap. From\r\n    what I can tell, I held my place from the top of the climb to the\r\n    end.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I scoped out the finish, and executed my plan for the end of the\r\n    race.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> And what do I want to do better next week?\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I don't think getting better results is all that complex. I need\r\n    to keep training &amp; get stronger, and I need to start quicker\r\n    off the line. Being near the front after the first few minutes\r\n    bodes <em>really</em> well for a good finish.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> So I'll keep up the interval training, and the strength work I've\r\n    been doing over the last few weeks. \r\n</p>\r\n",

    "intro": "<p> My recent training is paying\r\n    off <em>huge</em>. My <em>average</em> heart rate last night was\r\n    171bpm, which is nuts.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Temperatures were high, and with very little sustained climbing,\r\n    the pace was murderous. My heart rate jumped straight up above 170\r\n    and stayed there for at least the first 15 minutes, and rarely\r\n    dipped below that. (My <em>average</em> for the race was 171.)\r\n</p>\r\n    \r\n<p> I was sitting 10th until the very last half-mile or so, when I was\r\n    caught by two guys. They both sprinted past me in the final\r\n    seconds of the race to push me back to 12th. I was so cooked that\r\n    even when I realized I was in a bunch headed for the finish line,\r\n    it still didn't register that I should sprint out of the final\r\n    corner to hold them off, and even when they <em>passed</em> me, my\r\n    only thought was to check their leg markings to see if they were\r\n    in my division. Whups... \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I'm pleasantly surprised with how I feel today, after turning\r\n    myself inside-out last night. I'm fatigued, certainly, but I'm not\r\n    the kind of stiff &amp; sore I expected. One more way my trainaing\r\n    has paid off, I supposed.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I have thoughts about what went well, and what didn't. But\r\n    ultimately, it's clear that if I want to move up in the field,\r\n    I simply have to get stronger &amp; leaner. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I was told recently that I'm too big (frame, not fatness) for\r\n    cycling, but mountain biking is the realm of speedy gorillas. So\r\n    many guys in the field are built like power lifters. So my near-\r\n    to long-term training goals are to drop the rest of this excess\r\n    fat I'm carrying around, and add some serious muscle.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> But for now, the name of the game is to get out and do the rest of\r\n    my training for this week, and then recover &amp; prep for next\r\n    week's race.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "intro": "<p> I'm done numbering the weeks. Tahoe is off, and The Grizzly 100 is\r\n    at the end of September. That's close enough that I need to start\r\n    thinking about it, but today's not about that.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I just wrapped up the second block of Strava TCTP training, and\r\n    the results have been great.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I\r\n    used <a href=\"https://www.strava.com/segments/7617104\">Coachwhip</a>\r\n    as my fitness test. I've been chasing a new PR there for\r\n    a <em>long</em> time, and it's a sustained 10-minute dirt climb\r\n    close to home. My litmus test for the Strava program was: <em>Can\r\n    this restore forward progress to my Coachwhip PRs?</em>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Answer: <em>Hell yes.</em>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> The first training block improved my time from 9:25 to 9:12, good\r\n    enough for a new PR.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> The second block got me down to <b>8:53</b>, which I'm really\r\n    pleased with.

My endurance is up, I'm\r\n    holding my HR at 170BPM on my hill repeats (up from 165 or so) and\r\n    I'm recovering from workouts really well.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Interesting sidenote: I've noticed in the past that I need to\r\n    \"wake up\" my legs before I can perform at my best. I initially\r\n    attempted a PR after a day of easy riding and a rest day, and was\r\n    way, way off the pace.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I went back the very next day, and was <em>40 seconds</em> faster\r\n    to score that 8:53 PR.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I can't help thinking of the Limestone Canyon race, where I felt\r\n    sluggish. It was the same pattern: a day of easy riding, a day of\r\n    rest, then race. For my next race or PR attempt, I'll do some\r\n    riding the day before and see how that feels.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n",

    "intro": "<p> I lined up on Saturday morning for\r\n    the <a href=\"archive/3390\">Limestone Canyon race</a>. I've\r\n    resolved to race more often in 2019, and with Tahoe off the table,\r\n    I've been looking for smaller, closer options. Limestone certainly\r\n    fit the bill.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> A peek at the course map and a bit of Google satellite imagery\r\n    magic was nearly as good as a pre-ride. I printed out a little\r\n    cheat sheet that combined course cues with a tactical plan:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<table>\r\n    <tr>\r\n        <td>START</td>\r\n        <td>GO!</td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n    <tr>\r\n        <td>1.5</td>\r\n        <td>MOVE</td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n    <tr>\r\n        <td>1.9</td>\r\n        <td>CLIMB</td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n    <tr>\r\n        <td>4.0</td>\r\n        <td>RIDGE - 2 KICKERS</td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n    <tr>\r\n        <td>5.1</td>\r\n        <td>DESCEND</td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n    <tr>\r\n        <td>8.2</td>\r\n        <td>SHORT CLIMB</td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n    <tr>\r\n        <td>8.4</td>\r\n        <td>RIDGE</td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n    <tr>\r\n        <td>10.0</td>\r\n        <td>GO GO GO</td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n<p> I <em>hoped</em> I'd need the tactical info, but honestly I know\r\n    where I stand in the Sport class pecking order. Just the same, it was\r\n    really nice to have that on my top tube out on the course as a way\r\n    to measure my efforts, and especially to know when to expect\r\n    turns, climbs, etc.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> It was clear from the map that there were basically two key points\r\n    on the course. I figured that at mile 5.1, where the major\r\n    climbing topped out, whoever was out front would probably stay\r\n    there. And the best opportunity to be ahead at mile 5.1 would to\r\n    go to the riders at the front when the fire road funneled onto\r\n    singletrack at mile 2.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> So the funnel onto singletrack would be the first selection, and\r\n    the last two climbs on the ridge would be the second.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> So I wasn't surprised when the race organizers told everyone at\r\n    the start of the race: \"Get your passing done by mile 2.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I mentally prepped for a lung-busting start, and hoped that the\r\n    relatively flat singletrack to the first climb would provide a\r\n    chance to breathe &amp; find a sustainable rhythm.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Someone yelled, \"GO!\" and we were off.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I clipped in clean, and headed onto the fire road sitting top\r\n    10(-ish?), and tried to spin my way into solid position.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I don't think I was ruthless enough in passing. Several times, I\r\n    let gaps form a wheel or two ahead of me, and had to catch the\r\n    wheels of passing riders to get around, rather than pushing around\r\n    myself. That <em>might</em> be smart racing (maybe?), but it felt\r\n    like I was falling farther and farther back.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I'm reminded of a line from Sean Yates's book: \"The field is going\r\n    to split, and you're in the wrong half. MOVE UP.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> By the time I hit the singletrack, I was sitting <em>maybe</em>\r\n    top 15, felt, race stupid and my legs were toast. I figured the\r\n    leaders were well up the trail and <em>maybe</em> I was hanging\r\n    onto the back of the second group. I knew I'd have nothing left\r\n    for the ridgeline if I didn't get my HR down, so I dropped a\r\n    couple of gears, and tried to spin my way up the climb as easily\r\n    as I could.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> By the time I reached the ridgeline, I knew dialing back the\r\n    intensity was a good call, but I also had no idea if there was\r\n    anyone left behind me. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> At that point, I got into the headspace that works for me in this\r\n    situation: If there <em>is</em> anyone benind me, I want to hold\r\n    them off. And if anyone ahead crumbles or has a mechanical, I want\r\n    to be in position to capitalize. So I pushed on.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Right on cue at mile 5, the trail started down, and I let the bike\r\n    run. It was <em>really</em> nice to be able to push over the top\r\n    knowing I'd have a long descent to recover.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I passed a few riders on the way down through the canyon. One or\r\n    two were completely shattered, granny-gearing it home, and most\r\n    were coasting. In the past, the flats have been where I felt\r\n    extremely weak, but I found that my recent training was doing me\r\n    good. I didn't feel <em>powerful</em>, but I certainly had the gas\r\n    to hold a fast pace down through the canyon, which was satisfying.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> The final, short climb up to the ridgeline singletrack went easily\r\n    enough. The trail was <em>far</em> more groomed than anything\r\n    earlier in the course, which was nice, but I was well aware that I\r\n    could push <em>too</em> hard, or I'd detonate.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> The ridgeline singletrack was... not that much fun. It was loose\r\n    and rocky, and several little downhills had become rutted, narrow\r\n    funnels full of loose gravel. Throw in big prickly pear cacti here\r\n    and there, and I found myself worrying far more about not getting\r\n    hurt than about going fast.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Once I hit the fire road at mile 10, I just hit the gas and made\r\n    sure to hold off anyone who might be close behind. I took a couple\r\n    of looks behind me, didn't see anyone, and knew I'd probably be\r\n    fine if I just held my pace.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> The coast stayed clear all the way to the finish line. Final\r\n    place: 9th out of 13 in Sport Men 36-49.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> That's... pretty much what I expected. I was hoping for a solid\r\n    mid-pack finish, but I felt like I rode better than I expected,\r\n    and I see what I need to do to prep for future races.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> First, I need to get leaner. I'm just carrying around <em>way</em>\r\n    too much fat to be competitive. The single most obvious difference\r\n    between the Beginners and the top of the Sport class is their body\r\n    makup. Lots of bellies in the Beginners and slower Sport riders\r\n    (myself included). <em>Zero</em> excess body weight on the podium.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Second, I need to continue the structured training I've been doing. I\r\n    felt <em>so</em> much better after this race than any other race\r\n    I've done, and I felt like I was <em>much</em> stronger later in\r\n    the race than I would have been a few months ago.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> And third, any prep for future races needs to simulate the classic\r\n    local XC race start: 2 miles of fast fire road followed by steep\r\n    singletrack climbing.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> But I did a little number crunching, and I feel like moving up to\r\n    a top-5 finish next year is doable. With a 1:05:00 finish, I was\r\n    just 8 minutes off the podium, and just 10 minutes behind the\r\n    winner.

It felt fine. So today I pushed the pace.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I finished just 6 seconds off PR. And the graph above is kind of\r\n    bananas. All the places where I was crushing my old pace were the\r\n    steep climbs. All the sections where I was falling back were the\r\n    relatively easy stretches where I was a little spun out and\r\n    catching my breath.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> If I just match my old PR pace on the flats, I'll take about 30 seconds off my time.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> And when my legs get stronger and I'm spinning the new gear at the\r\n    same cadence as the old one, I'll be even faster than that.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> So that's good news. How did the checklist shake out?\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Drop a Pound: Nope</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li> Last Week: <b>182.4#</b>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li> This Week: <b>182.0#</b>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p> I weighed in on Thursday instead of waiting until Saturday morning, so that tilted the scales against me. But still. Dropping just .4 lbs. doesn't get me full credit.\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Ride 3+ Hours: Check!</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Finally tally: <b>4:08</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Do the \"hard climb\" three days: Check!</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Monday, Wednesday, and Thursday on the \"hard climb\", with a trip\r\n    up the \"Southside Switchies\" bring the weekly climbing total to\r\n    4465ft.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Next week is Christmas, so I'm aiming to relax and enjoy and let\r\n    my body recover from all this work. (Though the plan is to go to a\r\n    spin class on Christmas Eve. Never been before. We'll see how that\r\n    goes.)\r\n</p>\r\n",

I <em>was</em> having a single break &amp; bake\r\n    cookie with lunch, but I didn't get a chance to bake those this\r\n    week, so I've been eating the cookies from the cafe at work.

I noticed the freehub\r\n    catching a little bit early in my lunchtime ride, but it was fine\r\n    as long as I was pedaling, so I decided I'd get my workout and\r\n    deal with the problem when I got home.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Unfortunately, the innocuous catching got more serious, and\r\n    eventually (I still don't really understand how) the missing link\r\n    on my chain popped, leaving me chainless.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Luckily, the chain caught in my rear derailleur, so I didn't have\r\n    to go back and hunt for it. A few minutes of fiddling with a\r\n    replacement link had me moving again, but I had to baby the bike\r\n    all the way back to the office.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I didn't have time Thursday night to repair the rear wheel on my\r\n    mountain bike, which forced me into some road exploration.

I'm all set to ride.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Unfortunately, wrenching didn't leave a lot of time for cleaning, so while my drive train is shiny, the rest of the bike needs a bit of love.

I have <em>three</em> solid 10-\r\n    to 15-minute trail climbs reachable from where I'm working:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li> <a href=\"https://www.strava.com/segments/6107334\">Switchback Climb</a>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li> <a href=\"https://www.strava.com/segments/2664747\">Skyline the Hard Way</a>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li> <a href=\"https://www.strava.com/segments/8033829?filter=overall\">Switchbacks to Radio Towers</a>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p> <em>Skyline the Hard Way</em> is the toughest of the bunch, so I'm\r\n    taking my time mixing that in. I plan on doing it twice a week for\r\n    four weeks, then alternate twice-a-week and three-times-a-week for\r\n    a month, then do three-times-a-week for a month. I'm hoping\r\n    that'll be about when I've hit my target weight/body fat %, so\r\n    I'll make a decision then about how to proceed.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I've put together a rough training plan. I want to spend the next\r\n    couple of months focused on shedding fat while keeping\r\n    muscle. After that, I'll continue to watch my diet, but I'll be\r\n    fueling harder training rides, and eating to recover.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I looked at a few rides from my past, but they all have <em>too\r\n        much</em> climbing to make a decent comparison to the TT100. And\r\n    the local rides I've considered have to <em>little</em>.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> So I'm considering taking a day off work in the next couple of\r\n    months to go back to the Santa Monicas, where long climbs are\r\n    plentiful, and do a loop around Backbone or something. A 30mi ride\r\n    with about 3500ft of climbing should give me a clear idea of where\r\n    I'm at.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> In the meantime, I'm going to do a little Strava stalking and see\r\n    if there's anyone near me that has completed the TT100 and has\r\n    done a few of the same local loops/climbs as me.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>This Week's Checklist:</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li> Drop a pound\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li> Ride 3+ hrs\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li> Plan a benchmark ride that mimics the TT100's climbing/distance ratio\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n",

    "intro": "<p> I've officially started preparations for\r\n    the <a href=\"http://www.tahoetrailmtb.com/\">Tahoe Trail\r\n    100</a>. First item of business: get to my longtime target weight\r\n    under 180 lbs, at 12-14% body fat. (As measured by my unreliable\r\n    bathroom scale.)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Last week's weigh-in:</b> 194.8 lbs.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>This week's weigh-in:</b> 194.0 lbs.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I'm gonna call that a win. Basically, I ate my first meal of the\r\n    day <em>after</em> my first workout of the day, I ate home-cooked\r\n    food for nearly all my meals, and I cut my desert intake in\r\n    half. Aside from that, my food intake changed very little from\r\n    normal.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I'm hoping I can make steady progress over the next few months\r\n    (yes, even through the holidays), which should put me under 180\r\n    lbs in about four months. That leaves four months to eat for\r\n    recovery rather than weight loss, and be ready for the Tahoe Trail\r\n    100.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Since the first steps were so clear, I haven't bothered yet, but\r\n    at some point I'll sit down and work out a target time and a\r\n    training calendar and plot out the milestones I need to hit.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I'm reminded of an exchange I saw on <em>Billions</em>. It went\r\n    something like:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n    <p> \"Nobody at your stage in the game has master plan to get <em>there</em>.\"\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p> \"Nobody who gets there doesn't.\"\r\n    </p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p> I'll have to work backward from July 13, figure out my taper, and\r\n    work out some kind of target time.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Honestly, my first and only <em>real</em> goal is to participate\r\n    in and finish the race. Logistically and athletically, that'll be\r\n    a pretty great day.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> But it'll help my motivation in training to have a target time in\r\n    place, and a plan to achieve it. And it'll help my motivation\r\n    during the race to know I've trained well and have every\r\n    expectation of finishing.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> So. Final score for this week:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li> Drop a pound: check.\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li> Ride 3+ hrs: check\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p> Checklist for next week:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li> Drop a pound\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li> Ride 3+ hrs\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li> Sketch out a training calendar\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li> Plan benchmark ride that mimics TT100's climbing/distance ratio\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n",

And the fun\r\n    downhill is thin, covered in braking bumps, and washed out on the\r\n    outside of all the turns. Far from the smooth, bermy goodness I\r\n    was hoping for.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> On the other hand, it was the biggest ride I've done in\r\n    a <em>long</em> time, and recovered just fine, which is pretty\r\n    great.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> So here's what I did:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li> during the ride: 20 oz bottle with 3\r\n        scoops <a href=\"https://www.carborocket.com/online-store/333-Half-Evil-All-In-One-Endurance-Drink-p32260195\">CarboRocket\r\n        333</a>, plus a 16oz bottle with plain water\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li> immediately post-ride: 2.4g of BCAAs \r\n    </li>\r\n    <li> 30 minutes post-ride: big burrito &amp; 1l drink\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li> warmup and stretching later in the day:\r\n        <ul>\r\n            <li> easy kettlebell swings to warm up\r\n            </li>\r\n            <li> windmills 3 x 10 @ 25# (5 each side)\r\n            </li>\r\n            <li> Jefferson curl x 10 # 35#\r\n            </li>\r\n        </ul>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li> for the rest of the day: more water\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li> 3 capsules krill oil with dinner\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p> I definitely felt the fatigue today during my workout, but all in\r\n    all, I feel <em>great</em> for having just done such a big\r\n    ride.

    "intro": "<p> The stars aligned this week: I had time, health, and a working\r\n    bike, all at the same time. I rode <em>every day</em> this week.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> It's amazing what having a working, top-shelf fork can do for the\r\n    quality of a ride. My new Fox Float 32 Factory fork\r\n    is <em>awesome</em>. Little ripples and bumps disappear, and big\r\n    ones are manageable. Utterly confidence-inspiring. So, so much\r\n    better than the mushy, stiction-afflicted mess that was my old\r\n    Marzocchi.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I spent the first part of the week retracing familiar trails and\r\n    getting re-accustomed to real trail riding. So I focused on the\r\n    Yucca downhill (new PR), Grasshopper (ditto), and tried to make\r\n    sure each ride included plenty of climbing, just to get that into\r\n    my legs while I have the chance.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> And Friday afternoon, I decided not to sweat the pace, and instead\r\n    just explore what else I could find close to home. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I ended up riding some of the trails through Anaheim Hills. A bit\r\n    of singletrack along the creek, and some horse trails, but all of\r\n    it enjoyable. (Some of it simply because it's new, some because\r\n    it's genuinely great.)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> It's a near-perfect one-hour loop starting from the Weir Canyon\r\n    trailhead at the end of Hidden Canyon Rd. and looping east through\r\n    Weir, then connecting out to the neighborhood trails through\r\n    Anaheim Hills. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> The singletrack running south from Blue Sky Rd is genuinely\r\n    great. What a gem to find hidden in a suburban neighborhood. And\r\n    it was fun to connect Deer Canyon to other trails. Without those\r\n    connections, it's just an isolated out-and-back. Now I can link it\r\n    with neighborhood horse trails, and back to Weir.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I've always been a huge fan of hidden neighborhood trails/loops,\r\n    especially if they involve little secrets you only discover by\r\n    actually exploring what's there. This loop ticks all the\r\n    boxes. About an hour, 1300 ft of climbing, some fun singletrack,\r\n    some challenging technical climbing, and enough navigation to keep\r\n    my mind engaged. I'm <em>absolutely</em> going to go back and ride\r\n    this again when I get the chance.\r\n</p>\r\n",

    "body": "<p> <b>Fork: Fox Float 32 Factory 29er</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> My Marzocchi has been on its last legs for years, so when I\r\n    spotted a closeout deal on a top of the line Fox, I jumped on it.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> The first shake-out ride definitely felt weird, and I was worried\r\n    that I'd bought a fork that was radically unsuited to my\r\n    frame. But the geometry on the Fox is pretty close to the\r\n    Marzocchi, so I was skeptical that a few mm here and there could\r\n    add up to what I was feeling.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I made some adjustments, did another short, easy ride, and\r\n    something was definitely still not right. So I got out the tools\r\n    and got down to business.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> There was a little play at the crown, and some really noticeable\r\n    stickiness when turning the bars. It <em>felt</em> nearly\r\n    identical to when I first got my bike,\r\n    and <a href=\"archive/2575\">put the headset together\r\n    incorrectly</a>. So I pulled everything apart, and discovered that\r\n    I'd forgotten to install the crown race. Doh.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I fixed my mistake, and everything feels <em>much</em> better.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Rear Bearings</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> The bearings in my rear hub were complaining, so I decided to\r\n    replace them with the spares I bought <a href=\"archive/3310\">last\r\n        time</a>.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Unfortunately, my improvised bearing press damaged the new\r\n    bearings on the way in. (Hardly surprising.) When I turned the\r\n    axle it felt like it was dipped in crunchy peanut butter. Bah.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> So I ordered new bearings and a set of <a href=\"http://a.co/8MGyJ4u \">over-axle drift\r\n    adapters</a>. Still kind of half-assed, but it worked well enough.\r\n    The whole thing went together nice and smooth, and the rear wheel\r\n    is now spinning perfectly.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Stan's Rim Tape</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> A couple of <a href=\"archive/3361\">flats</a> lately damaged the\r\n    rim tape on my rear wheel to the point where it simply wasn't\r\n    holding air any more. So I bit the bullet, ordered the tape, and\r\n    replaced the tape that came installed with the wheels.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> The wheel is losing air between rides, so I clearly did an\r\n    imperfect job. But it's holding plenty well enough to ride\r\n    on. When I have the time &amp; energy, I'll take another crack at\r\n    taping the rim.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>New GPS Mount</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> In the course of monkeying with my bars, I managed to break my\r\n    Barfly 3.0 GPS mount. The Barfly 4.0 is every bit as terrible as\r\n    the 3.0 is wonderful. (Heavier, bulkier, requires a shim for my\r\n    bars.)  So I've opted for a Sram Quickview mount, which is\r\n    basically the same as the old Barfly.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Saddle: Ergon SMR-3 Comp</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I bought\r\n    an <a href=\"https://ergonbike.myshopify.com/products/smr3-comp\">Ergon\r\n    SMR-3 Comp</a> to replace my <a href=\"archive/3359\">busted\r\n    saddle</a>. The front is narrower than my old saddle, and the back\r\n    is wider, so... yeah. Still forming an opinion.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Rear Brake</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I'd noticed my rear brake was rubbing a bit on the rotor. Further\r\n    inspection revealed that the pads weren't retracting evenly.

My rides\r\n    are <a href=\"http://danjohn.net/2012/01/but-this-is-how-i-know-you-didnt-do-it/\">punch-the-clock\r\n    workouts</a>, and I'm measuring progress by how I'm doing in the\r\n    gym, where training time is less restrictive. (Doing okay at an\r\n    Over the Hump race certainly helped with this.)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> My workout routine is consistent, and workouts now include basics\r\n    I used to neglect, like running, chin-ups/pull-ups, loaded\r\n    carries, and stretching.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> My lunchtime rides are <em>far</em> higher-quality than they were\r\n    eight weeks ago. I'm riding my trail bike more than my road bike,\r\n    and my regular loop includes plenty of fire-road-style dirt, which\r\n    is a <em>massive</em> upgrade that I'm not sure would have\r\n    happened without a conscious decision to seek out better routes.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I <a href=\"archive/3342\">raced</a>, and even performed reasonably\r\n    well.

I can see in the\r\n    mirror that I'm adding muscle, and I'm noticeably stronger in the\r\n    gym, so I'm not <em>too</em> upset. But still, I know that the\r\n    single best thing I can do for my fitness is to get my body fat\r\n    down around 12%. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Bringing lunch to work will require me to make changes to my\r\n    weekly routine. I can't just \"try to find something\" on weekday\r\n    mornings. I've got to shop ahead of time, and do the prep over the\r\n    weekend.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Take-Aways</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> One pattern that emerged is that if I'm not making progress toward\r\n    a goal, I need to break it down into smaller pieces that\r\n    I <em>can</em> execute.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> What's <em>not</em> obvious about this is that a single, all-day,\r\n    high-priority task might be one item on the to-do list. \"Clean\r\n    garage,\" for instance, might be one item\r\n    <em>if</em> I plan to start after breakfast on Saturday morning\r\n    and continue until it's completely done. On the other hand, if I\r\n    know that I'm only going to have one-hour chunks of time to work\r\n    on the garage, then I'm going to break down \"Clean Garage\" into\r\n    30- to 60-minute tasks. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Doing okay in the Over the Hump race quieted my worries that my\r\n    on-bike training isn't enough. It gave me the confidence to just\r\n    keep my focus on general strength and conditioning work, and on\r\n    losing fat. If anything, I know I need to turn up the\r\n    intensity <em>in the gym</em>, and if I'm going to tweak any part\r\n    of my bike training, it should be to add short, sharp\r\n    climbs. (30-60 seconds, as steep as I can find.)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> And, honestly, I think the notion of having one or two achievable\r\n    weekly goals works really well for me. So I'll keep doing\r\n    that. But not with the intensity I have been, and not directed at\r\n    fitness or cycling.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> For the next couple of weeks, my mental energy needs to be focused\r\n    on executing at work.

    "intro": "<p> The other riders clued me in at the lineup: the course was\r\n    different from last week. Three laps, not two, and no big climb. I\r\n    wasn't sure what to do about that, so I just went with my goal of\r\n    starting strong and hanging with the lead pack as long as I could.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <a href=\"http://results.replaytiming.com/Results.aspx?CId=16561&RId=78&EId=7\">Results</a> (<a href=\"attachments/08152017-results.csv\">DMG copy</a>)\r\n</p>\r\n",
    "body": "<p> That turned out well for me. The guys at the front controlled the\r\n    pace for the first quarter mile or so before opening up a bit when\r\n    we hit dirt. The field would spread out and come back together as\r\n    we negotiated a few side trails east of the start/finish area.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I was <em>with</em> the lead group, but I could see that I was\r\n    working harder than them. Then we hit the asphalt leading out the\r\n    gravel access road, and they hit the gas. I tried to go, but\r\n    simply didn't have it. Wasn't even a question. The field split,\r\n    and I did my best to mark my position. It seemed like about 7 guys\r\n    ahead, and maybe 3 behind? I wasn't sure.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> The first and second laps get kind of hazy after that. I just\r\n    tried to keep the pressure on, not overcook the rises, make the\r\n    most of the downhills, and pass efficiently where I could. I took\r\n    mental notes about where I could coast without losing position,\r\n    and where bunch-ups were happening.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I do rememember getting passed by a kid (might have been 14 or\r\n    so?) on one of the climbs. \"Good job!\" he said as he went by. So,\r\n    so great. One of the things that impressed me the most about this\r\n    event was how involved all the kids were, and how positive the\r\n    vibe was around them. I really hope I can share something like\r\n    this with my daughter when she's ready.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> On the third lap, I caught a rider in blue on the gravel road. I\r\n    tucked in behind him for a minute, trying to relax get ready for\r\n    the quick climb coming up. His pace flagged for a few seconds, so\r\n    I pulled around and tried to open a gap.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> That mostly worked, but we came back together on the short rise at\r\n    the end of the fire road, and a rider in green came around and got\r\n    ahead of us on the doubletrack.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> The three of us leapfrogged for a few minutes, then I managed to\r\n    pass them both on the wide climb after the doubletrack, and keep\r\n    the pressure on to the top of the downhill. I was definitely\r\n    spending the rest of my matches, but there was nothing left to\r\n    save them for anyway. The course was super-fast from the last\r\n    downhill to the finish, so I figured I might be able to hold them\r\n    off if I cranked the downhill and held my speed.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> The guy in blue was on my ass the whole time, which gave me the\r\n    adrenline kick I needed to stay on the gas.  But in the end it\r\n    worked-- I held out for 9th place, Blue took 10th, and the guy in\r\n    green ended up about 10 seconds back in 11th.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> The three of us ended up chatting after the finish about how much\r\n    fun that last lap had been. This really is a huge part of why I\r\n    love these local races-- even if you're sitting well off the\r\n    podium, there will be a few other riders at your level and you can\r\n    have a great time just racing <em>them</em>. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> So, how did I fare with my goals for this race?\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Line up early, start strong, and hang with the lead pack as\r\n        long as I can.</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Check!\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>The race takes shape on the one and only climb. Give it all I've got.</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> The course change made this one moot. But I did manage to find a\r\n    decisive moment (the last few climbs before the speedy finish) and\r\n    make the most of it. So I'm happy with this one.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Don't finish last.</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Check! Solid mid-pack finish and a ride I'm happy with.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Keep my head in the game, and have fun.</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Check!\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I've been looking to put my bad day\r\n    at <a href=\"archive/3304\">Santiago</a> behind me, and I did that.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> So... what now?\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I <em>really</em> want to do more of these next year. I had a\r\n    great time, and I'm now super-motivated to get into better shape.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> My endurance is fine for these short races. Last night's race was\r\n    about 10 minutes longer than usual, and I picked up\r\n    at <em>least</em> 2 positions in that last 10 minutes.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> And while I can feel that the weight training is helping, my\r\n    top-end W/kg is where I lacked last night. So I'm on the right\r\n    track. The plan is more heavy deadlifts and squats, and looking to\r\n    get my weight down under 175 lbs.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> All in all, great fun, and I can't wait to jump in again next year!\r\n</p>\r\n"

I should have done\r\n    more research, and\r\n    found <a href=\"https://www.mtbproject.com/trail/7012139\">this\r\n    loop</a>. (I'd have shortened it, but still.)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> The riding was mostly on fire roads. What little singletrack I did\r\n    find was in really rough shape. And the heat &amp; unfamiliar\r\n    territory made\r\n    the <a href=\"https://www.strava.com/segments/7060984\">Bobcat\r\n    Ridge</a> climb (570', 1.7 mi) feel <em>far</em> harder than it\r\n    really is.

    "body": "<p> We've come a <em>long</em> way from the days\r\n    of <a href=\"archive/2170\">paper maps and cue sheets</a>. The\r\n    combination of Strava's route planning features and GPS devices\r\n    made it insanely easy to find places to ride, map out planned\r\n    routes, and load them onto my Garmin so that once I was on the\r\n    bike, I just had to listen for the little burp from my Garmin that\r\n    tells me I'm <em>off</em> course, and otherwise just enjoy the\r\n    ride.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Glendale Sports Complex Ride</h3>\r\n\r\n<p> On Monday I parked at the Glendale Sports Complex and explored the\r\n    ridges above. Fun switchbacks, and short, punchy climbs were the\r\n    norm, as well as a fair bit of fire road climbing. I worked in as\r\n    much singletrack as I could. Liz's Loop was a highlight: a sweet\r\n    bit of singletrack looking north across Pasadena and La Canada\r\n    Flintridge to the San Gabriel mountains.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I had a lot of fun on this loop, and very nearly returned on\r\n    Wednesday. But I'm glad I didn't.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>JPL Loop: Fern Up, El Prieto Cyn Down</h3>\r\n\r\n<p> This is a <em>spectacular</em> loop in Pasadena. I found it and\r\n    rode it in the correct direction (clockwise) by blind\r\n    luck. (The <a href=\"https://www.mtbproject.com/trail/7011443\">MTB\r\n    Project</a> has details on this exact loop, but I somehow found it\r\n    the hard way, by tinkering with the Strava route building tool.)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Fern is a smooth single/doubletrack climb that countours up the\r\n    west side of a ridgeline north of JPL. Monday's punchy climbs\r\n    didn't really leave me with much gas in the tank, so just focused\r\n    on keeping a steady pace and enjoying the ride.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> When I reached the lookout, I really would have loved to keep\r\n    climbing up to Wella's Peak, but I had to admit that I wasn't sure\r\n    I had the legs for it, and I wanted to leave a little gas in the\r\n    tank in case the return leg down El Prieto was more demanding than\r\n    expeced. (Or in case something else went wrong.) So I took a\r\n    minute to enjoy the few, and headed down.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I'm <em>so</em> glad I saved my legs for El Prieto. It's\r\n    an <em>amazing</em> trail down a breathtaking canyon, and it's\r\n    full of super-fun technical features that kept me on my toes. (It\r\n    earns it's <a href=\"https://www.mtbproject.com/trail/916170\">black\r\n    diamond rating</a>.) I walked a few sections, and my switchback\r\n    game <a href=\"https://www.strava.com/segments/1656249\">isn't what\r\n    it was</a>, but man, I'll jump at the next chance I get to ride\r\n    this trail again.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Random Thoughts &amp; Takeaways</h3>\r\n\r\n<p> With less time to ride lately, I'm torn between two sides of my\r\n    personality. Part of me wants to log big climbs and long rides\r\n    when I get the chance. In fact, I had originally planned to climb\r\n    <a href=\"https://www.strava.com/segments/1360087\">Brand Cyn</a>,\r\n    which would have been satisfying but boring. And I thought about\r\n    repeating the Glendale Sports Complex ride to see how fast I could\r\n    do it now that I knew the route.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I'm glad I listened to the other part, which told me to take\r\n    advantage of the chance to ride somewhere new, even if there was a\r\n    decent chance the trail might not be great. I lucked into an\r\n    absolutely stellar loop.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> And, honestly, online resources like Strava and MTB Project are\r\n    making it easier and easier to find &amp; ride really great\r\n    trails. With just a little effort, the odds of a dud trail ride\r\n    are getting increasingly remote.\r\n</p>\r\n"

It didn't <em>feel</em> that rough,\r\n    but my legs were <em>super</em> tired over the weekend, and I\r\n    could feel that I needed to let them rest\r\n    (no <a href=\"archive/3322\">nano-workouts</a>!) and I considered\r\n    making this week a back-off week. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> But on Monday I felt reasonably ready to ride, so I did my normal\r\n    interval sesession, but kept the total volume to a minimum. Warm\r\n    up, work out, be done.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I felt sluggish for Wednesday's \"LSD\" ride, and even got passed by\r\n    a guy on an old mountain bike with a fishing pole and tackle box\r\n    bungeed to the back. I was struggling into the wind at the time,\r\n    and not really paying attention, and was wobbling right down the\r\n    middle of the path.

His recommendation was to anticipate the top\r\n    of the pedal stroke so that you engage your glutes right at the\r\n    top.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I couldn't get the timing right. So instead of thinking\r\n    about <em>timing</em>, adjusted the \"target\" I was pushing toward.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Instead of pushing straight down through the bottom of the pedal\r\n    revolution, I pushed down and <em>away</em>, through a point about\r\n    40&deg;\r\n    <em>forward</em> of the bottom.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Nitpicky, certainly. But I can feel my glutes and low back\r\n    engaging much more, and that'll help my climbing. (And over time\r\n    is probably nicer on my knees.)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I thought I'd get bored with bike path rides really fast,\r\n    but <a href=\"archive/3324\">getting better</a> really is a powerful\r\n    motivator for me. By giving my lunchtime rides a purpose (treating\r\n    them like training sessions, with performance goals), I've made\r\n    them into something that keeps me motivated and interested. It's\r\n    like going to the gym. It's not \"real\" riding, but it's an\r\n    abstraction, like the squat rack or the treadmill.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> The plan for this week is more of the same: intervals, LSD,\r\n    intervals. For now, that works for my body. (Especially since the\r\n    intervals are essentially all-out.)\r\n</p>\r\n"

(It currently tells me I'm totally slacking on the TGU's for\r\n    instance.)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> That lets me use my lunchtimes for stuff that\r\n    actually <em>requires</em> a continuous block: cycling & general\r\n    cardio.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I've been doing a hyper-condensed version of Steady Effort Power\r\n    Interval workout from <em>The Time-Crunched Cyclist</em>:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li> 10-15min @ 140bpm, 90rpm\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li> 5 work intervals:\r\n        <ul>\r\n            <li> 2min @ 170+bpm, 90+rpm\r\n            </li>\r\n            <li> 3min rest @ 140bpm, 90rpm\r\n            </li>\r\n        </ul>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p> I'll steadily reduce the rest between intervals, increase the\r\n    number of work intervals, etc. until I max out my use of the time\r\n    I have.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> All of this is going <em>really</em> well.

And yet I logged four solid workouts last\r\n    week.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> So yeah. This is going way, way better than I expected. So many\r\n    people (and training programs) ask, \"How much do I have to train\r\n    to achieve my goal?\" I think it's far more effective to ask, \"What\r\n    can I accomplish in the time I have?\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> In a more general sense, the key lies in asking not, \"Where can I\r\n    find what I want?\" but rather, \"What can I do with what I have?\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I have 30-40 minutes a day, and easy access to a bike path along a\r\n    huge concrete flood control channel. I'm determined to make the\r\n    most of those resources.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n",
    "body": "<h3>Running</h3>\r\n\r\n<p> Running has been unexpectedly nice. I like the simplicity of it. I\r\n    like that I can get a solid workout in 20 minutes, and I like that\r\n    I've gotten a chance to break out some of\r\n    my <a href=\"http://www.patagonia.com/product/mens-houdini-windbreaker-jacket/24141.html?dwvar_24141_color=ANDB&cgid=root#tile-5=&q=houdini&lang=en_US&start=1&sz=24\">favorite\r\n    gear</a> and get out and about in some beautiful, but chilly,\r\n    weather. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Cycling</h3>\r\n\r\n<p> My cycling plan is to look again at some of the concepts from\r\n    the <a href=\"archive/3021\">Time-Crunched Training Protocol</a> and\r\n    see what I can use. Intervals are pretty much the textbook example\r\n    of how to make the most of limited training time.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I'd initially worried that having only a straight, flat bike path\r\n    to ride on would hamper my training. Certainly, I expect my\r\n    climbing to suffer a bit. But I'm pleased that I get to attack a\r\n    major weakness of mine: flats. (And, I suspect, a general tendency\r\n    to fade as hard efforts continue.) This also gives me a chance to\r\n    work on my pedaling technique.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Kettlebells</h3>\r\n\r\n<p> A heavy kettlebell is bascally a portable gym. I bring my 50# with\r\n    me and work out in the park a couple blocks from the office. It\r\n    takes about 45 minutes, including the drive to/from the park.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>Inline Skates</h3>\r\n\r\n<p> Skates are <em>perfect</em> for long, flat bike paths. And there's\r\n    reason to believe that skating is <em>excellent</em> training for\r\n    cycling. Honestly, though, skating is the <em>bottom</em> item on\r\n    the priority list at the moment. Once fair weather lines up with a\r\n    \"rest day\", I'll lace up my skates and get out there. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Cleanup</h3>\r\n\r\n<p> We don't have showers at work. So I've been doing\r\n    the <a href=\"archive/3318\">cleanup routine</a> that I cobbled together\r\n    from various bits of advice I found online. It seems to work well.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n    <li> Dry off sweat with clean towell\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li> Clean up with <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00B8EDYPK/ref=od_aui_detailpages00?ie=UTF8&psc=1\">disposable wash cloths</a>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li> Splash water on my face & hair, dry with paper towel.\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li> Refresh hair gel, apply deoderant, etc.\r\n    </li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p> I've asked a couple friends at work to give me a heads-up if I'm\r\n    ever... <em>not so fresh</em>.

I do not do it because \"staying in shape\"\r\n    makes me happy. I ride and work out because <em>riding and working\r\n    out</em> makes me happy. The workout isn't the means. It's the\r\n    end.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> And for the last few months, I've been agonizing over how to\r\n    essentially build a lifeboat for that part of me that is a\r\n    mountain biker, so that I can reclaim him <em>if</em> my life ever\r\n    allows it. I've thought of this entirely in terms of saying in\r\n    shape for the next few years, how to preserve my fitness so that I\r\n    can get back to enjoying that fitness <em>some day</em>.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> And that just made me even <em>more</em> sad, because I'm getting\r\n    my <em>own</em> motivation backward. I should know myself well\r\n    enough to know that treating fitness as the primary goal isn't\r\n    going to motivate me. I shouldn't be looking for a way to <em>stay\r\n    in shape</em>, I should be looking for a <em>challenging\r\n    workout</em> that fits into my life.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Yes, there's a certain level of practicality required here. But I\r\n    need to work within my own psychology so that my goal isn't \"stay\r\n    in shape\", but rather \"continue to be someone who gets outside and\r\n    works hard.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> The general plan is lunchtime workouts, with a smattering of\r\n    kettlebells, inline skating, running, and maybe some bike\r\n    intervals.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> With the arrival of a new member of the family, the primary focus\r\n    will be taking care of my child and my wife, and continuing to\r\n    bring my A game to work every day.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> But I also need to take care of myself. And that means continuing\r\n    to work out consistently and intensely. So, in the spirit\r\n    of <a href=\"archive/2672\">preparedness and opportunity</a>, I'm\r\n    getting set to take advantage of my lunch break if/when I can. I\r\n    figure if I can do that a few times a week, I'll avoid totally\r\n    slacking off on fitness.\r\n</p>\r\n"

This means that at any given moment, my own shit is 100%\r\n    handled. I am clean-shaven &amp; showered, I am wearing clean\r\n    clothes, and the house is generally tidy.  In the broader sense,\r\n    it means that nothing is stacking up: dishes are not accumulating,\r\n    laundry is done (washed, folded, stowed), there is a ready supply\r\n    of clean baby bottles, etc.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Be-Prepared-Practical-Handbook-Dads-ebook/dp/B000SEKFZI/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1484861937&sr=8-1\">Be\r\n    Prepared: A Practical Handbook for New Dads</a> was recommended by\r\n    a coworker, and has been really helpful.

This book gives you more things to\r\n    try.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Tools</h3>\r\n\r\n<p> My wife and I have found it immensely helpful to have a log of\r\n    when our daughter has eaten and needed diaper\r\n    changes. <a href=\"https://appsto.re/us/T1jEU.i\">Baby Tracker</a>\r\n    has been a great for that. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> My <a href=\"http://www.mountainhardwear.com/sleeping-equipment-sleepingbags/\">Mountain\r\n    Hardware sleeping bag</a> was absolutely invaluable during our\r\n    stay in the hospital. Each night I slept in my bag, warm and\r\n    comfortable despite being stretched out on a glorified cot. No\r\n    clue what I'd have done without it. (PRO TIP: have a pair of wolly\r\n    socks to sleep in, and leave them in the bottom of your sleeping\r\n    bag.)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> In the week after returning home from the hospital, I lived in\r\n    basically two sets of long underwear:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li><a href=\"http://www.columbia.com/mens-heavyweight-ii-stretch-baselayer-tight-1638551.html?cgid=men-pantsShorts-baselayer&dwvar_1638551_variationColor=010#start=1\">Columbia Heavyweight Stretch Baselayer Tights</a>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li><a href=\"http://www.patagonia.com/product/mens-capilene-lightweight-bottoms/45681.html?dwvar_45681_color=FGE&cgid=mens-baselayers-lightweight#start=1\">Patagonia\r\n            Capilene Lightweigth Bottoms</a>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p> Unexpectedly, I found that having\r\n    my <a href=\"http://www.benchmade.com/griptilian-family.html\">Benchmade\r\n    Griptilian</a> folding knife handy was incredibly helpful. This\r\n    knife has taken years of abuse and is still 100% solid. Can't\r\n    recommend it highly enough.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> And my to-do list\r\n    manager, <a href=\"https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus\">OmniFocus</a>\r\n    has been vital. I haven't used it <em>much</em>, since most of\r\n    what I've been doing involves the same few things over and\r\n    over. But that just means that when something outside that flow\r\n    needs to get done, it's all the more important that it goes on my\r\n    to-do list.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I'm\r\n    also <em>loving</em> <a href=\"https://sparkmailapp.com/\">Spark</a>\r\n    as my iOS email app. After 4 solid days in the hospital focused on\r\n    my wife and newborn child, Spark let me dig out of email hell in\r\n    no time.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Prioritize and Execute</h3>\r\n\r\n<dl>\r\n    <dt>care for the kid</dt>\r\n    <dd>This is obvious. Do all the child care stuff. Feeding, diaper\r\n        changes, play time. When the need arises, drop whatever else\r\n        you're doing and do <em>this</em>.\r\n    </dd>\r\n\r\n    <dt>care for your wife</dt>\r\n    <dd>Giving birth pretty much stands as my <em>definition</em> of\r\n        \"taking one for the team.\" Her job is to recover and\r\n        (depending on lactation/latching/etc. issues) feed the\r\n        baby. Your job is <em>literally everything else</em>.\r\n    </dd>\r\n    \r\n    <dt>care for yourself</dt>\r\n    <dd>Shower and shave every day. Take naps when you can. Eat\r\n        right. (One of the best decisions I made was to avoid all\r\n        sweets for the last couple of weeks. You simply can't eat\r\n        garbage and keep up with the demands of the first weeks of\r\n        parenthood.)\r\n    </dd>\r\n\r\n    <dt>care for the house</dt>\r\n    <dd>Stay <em>aggressively</em> on top of dishes, laundry, cleaning\r\n        bottles, making the bed in the guest room, etc. It all seems\r\n        like it <em>can</em> wait, but it makes life <em>much</em>\r\n        easier if you have clean towels, blankets, t-shirts, pajamas,\r\n        readily to hand. Consider: the baby has just projectile\r\n        vomited 3 oz. of milk into her onsie, her swaddling blankets,\r\n        and (impossibly) her hat, as well as your t-shirt and\r\n        pajamas. In that moment, you're going to be either really glad\r\n        you have fresh clothes and blankets for the both of you, or\r\n        you're going to have to get creative with what's in the linen\r\n        closet. It's up to you which world you want to live in.\r\n    </dd>\r\n</dl>\r\n\r\n<h3>Kettlebells &amp; General Fitness</h3>\r\n\r\n<p> I've been <em>floored</em> at how much stronger I feel doing\r\n    everyday parental &amp; household stuff because of my recent\r\n    kettlebell training. Turkish get-ups in particular\r\n    are <em>gold</em>.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> In particular, I've depended on one-handed movements to get me\r\n    through the day, and I've needed a posterior chain that can handle\r\n    leaning/twisting/sitting strangely for hours each day. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> And I've been smart enough not to try to work out or add any extra\r\n    physical exertion to my days. The chiropractor that helped me sort\r\n    out my shoulder/arm issues a couple years back made a really valid\r\n    point: your body's recovery systems don't differentiate between\r\n    life stress and workout stress. If one is already maxed out,\r\n    adding the other is unwise.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Feeding Myself</h3>\r\n\r\n<p> I find my wife and I are getting <em>enough</em> sleep, but we're\r\n    getting it in smaller chunks and at odd times. So I've been\r\n    leveraging something I learned a few years ago on a trip to\r\n    Germany: <a href=\"archive/2766\">my stomach is in\r\n    charge</a>. Eating high-protein meals/snacks at the normal time of\r\n    day (7AM, 11AM, 3PM, 6PM) seems to help my body stay anchored in a\r\n    normal circadian cycle.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Ideally,\r\n        180+. That will help me maintain my aerobic top end.\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>Time: 20 min at minimum, 40 optimum. \r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>Type: I don't care. Everything's on the table. Barbell,\r\n        kettlebell, jump rope, inline skating, running, even\r\n        cycling. Whatever I can make time for.\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p> I need to consistently hit my top-end output:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li> aerobic capacity: (HR should stay above 120 BPM, and\r\n        hit 170-180+ for a total of 5+ min.)\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li> strength: move something heavy in all 5 of Dan John's\r\n        fundamental movements: push, pull, hinge, squat,\r\n        loaded carry, and TGU/other.\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li> power: lots of force, fast. Cleans &amp; swings.\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li> stamina: do sets in the 20+ reps range.

It's amazing how easy it is.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> But I think it's a problem that discussions of trail etiquette\r\n    always seem to lead to what <em>mountain bikers</em> should do. We\r\n    all have to work <em>together</em> to keep each other\r\n    safe. Hikers, horseback riders, and mountain bikers.

    "intro": "<p> It's been tough to get much time on the bike lately. As of\r\n    Saturday morning, I'd logged less than 3 hours in the last\r\n    three <em>weeks</em>. So I was excited to have\r\n    the <em>perfect</em> Sunday schedule: brunch with friends in the\r\n    morning, then an open afternoon to go for a ride.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I had time to ride, but not enough time to head very far from\r\n    home. (Unless I wanted to spend more time driving than riding.) So\r\n    it was Santiago. I decided I wanted to hit\r\n    the <a href=\"https://www.strava.com/activities/786508768/segments/19225019350\">steep\r\n    stream crossing</a>\r\n    and <a href=\"https://www.strava.com/segments/630245\">Chutes</a>,\r\n    and otherwise just ride wherever I felt like.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I'm (re-)discovering that that's a recipe for a really fun\r\n    ride. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I had fun developing a \"theme\" of doing oft-ridden trails\r\n    \"backward.\" Where that wasn't possible, I generally took whatever\r\n    trail I'd ridden least. The result was that I got to explore\r\n    familiar trails from a new perspective, and have fun riding some\r\n    stuff I hadn't in a while.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Climbing Grasshopper was really fun. I remember the\r\n    very <a href=\"http://dreadedmonkeygod.net/home/maps/20150717-santiago-oaks.gpx\">first\r\n    time I did it</a>, and at the time I was just learning my way\r\n    around these trails, and really didn't know what to expect. It's\r\n    nice to have made Santiago into \"home turf.\" I still got beat by\r\n    the real crux of that climb, though: a short kicker climb followed\r\n    by a hard right turn into a steep rock garden. On hindsight, I\r\n    should have given that section another try, since I was basically\r\n    done climbing for the day. I'll have to give it a real try next\r\n    time.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I also took this as an opportunity to confirm the results of\r\n    my <a href=\"archive/3314\">accidental experiment</a> last week. I\r\n    followed my usual protocol completely, and I feel great.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n",

Especially on the first couple of rides, I\r\n    felt stronger than usual toward the end of the ride, and recovered\r\n    more quickly and completely between punchy efforts.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> What's interesting is that I'm starting to associate the smell of\r\n    the grape CarboRocket with \"go time.\" I get a whiff of grape, and\r\n    I start getting stoked to ride.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Shimano Chain</h3>\r\n\r\n<p> I <a href=\"archive/3306\">broke my KMC chain</a> a while back and\r\n    replaced it with a Shimano, and I have to say that the Shimano\r\n    seems to perform a bit better. Smoother shifting, longer-lasting\r\n    lube, etc.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I have a spare KMC chain ready to roll, so I'm kind of tempted to\r\n    put the Shimano through the same trial on Deer that broke the\r\n    KMC. If it survives, so much the better. If not, then I know the\r\n    KMC is cheaper, easier to work on, <em>and</em> just as strong.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    "intro": "<p> I've been a bit homesick for the trails around the Santa Monica\r\n    Mountains. I really think the Conejo Valley is a world-class\r\n    cycling destination. Hundreds of miles of stellar trails, and some\r\n    of the best road riding anywhere. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I'm starting to realize that returning to Santiago Oaks Park over\r\n    and over agin for my after-work rides has sapped a lot of my\r\n    motivation for cycling. I don't <em>crave</em> variety, but when I\r\n    get it, I suddenly find my enthusiasm re-stoked for the next ride.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> So I'm doing what I have to do to get that variety, and to explore\r\n    more of Orange County.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Last night I rode\r\n    the <a href=\"https://www.mtbproject.com/trail/3000688/fullerton-loop\">Fullerton\r\n    Loop</a>, an 11-mile, non-technical mixed dirt &amp; pavement loop\r\n    around Fullerton. It's kind of cobbled together, using\r\n    neighborhood horse trails, walking paths, and a few railroad\r\n    rights-of-way. It is, honestly, my favorite kind of ride: an ally\r\n    cat's view of the area, bringing out exactly what I love about\r\n    mountain bikes: that they can go <em>anywhere</em>. It's a\r\n    never-ending game of <em>Where does <b>that</b> path go?</em>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> And even though this route is generally tagged as a \"newbie ride,\"\r\n    an hour of pushing the pace really <em>did</em> feel like a\r\n    workout, and the variety of trails kept me interested the whole\r\n    time.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> And I was surprised to find this route also offers a chance to\r\n    hone <em>skills</em>.  I've <em>got</em> to learn to bunny\r\n    hop. There are just so many little curbs and logs and street\r\n    crossings where it would be great to be able to just carry\r\n    momentum through instead of having to slow down.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> And there's plenty of \"extra credit\" stuff connected to this loop.\r\n    I think I'm going to spend a lot of time exploring!\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Back then I\r\n    called them <a href=\"archive/3201\">mini workouts</a>, but they're\r\n    not that small, really.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n    <ul>\r\n        <li> kb swing 3 x 20 @ 35#\r\n        </li>\r\n        <li> kb swing 3 x 20 @ 50#\r\n        </li>\r\n        <li> 1-arm kb swing 3 x 20 @ 35#\r\n        </li>\r\n        <li> Bulgarian split squat 3 x 40 @ 35# (20 each leg)\r\n        </li>\r\n        <li> knee push-up 3 x 24 (shoulder &amp; chest prehab/rehab)\r\n        </li>\r\n        <li> Turkish get-up x 10 @ 50#\r\n        </li>\r\n    </ul>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p> And I'm returning to what got my Bulldog time under 40 minutes:\r\n    Three rides/wk, as follows:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n    <li> Warm up, work hard for 30 minutes (or accumulate 30 min. of\r\n        interval work), then cool down and go home.

(~1500ft)\r\n    </li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p> My little goal is to get Coachwhip in under 9:00. That's 6.7 mph\r\n    for 0.9 miles, 400ft of climbing, for a VAM of just over 800. I\r\n    did Bulldog with a VAM of 790. I should be able to hold 800 for a\r\n    quarter of the time.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Poison Oak</h3>\r\n\r\n<p> All that <em>was</em> off to a decent start, but then I got hit\r\n    with a nasty case of poison oak on my left shin and calf. I'm also\r\n    having a systemic allergic reaction: swollen feet and hands, and\r\n    itching in areas untouched by the actual plant. I'm taking\r\n    medication to get that under control, and around mid-week this\r\n    week (when the swelling really kicked in), I decided to just take\r\n    whatever time my body needs to get back on track. So I was off the\r\n    bike basically all last week.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I rode on Monday and felt okay, but life stuff has kept me off the\r\n    trails since then, and will probably keep me off the bike this\r\n    weekend, too. So... yeah. Two weeks no training. No bueno.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>Mountain Bike Maintenance: New Chain</h3>\r\n\r\n<p> I busted my KMC chain trying to switch gears while cranking up a\r\n    punchy rise on Deer. Amazon was too slow, so I replaced it with\r\n    the Shimano I had on a shelf. So far, it seems like the Shimano is\r\n    just slightly smoother. But I <em>love</em> the missing link setup\r\n    on the KKC, so I <em>might</em> just go ahead and pop the \"master\r\n    link\" on the Shimano and replace it with a KMC missing link and\r\n    see how <em>that</em> stands up. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Might be genius. Might be deeply unwise. One way to find out.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>Road Bike Maintenance</h3>\r\n\r\n<p> A friend has invited me to join him in breaking in his new bike,\r\n    so we're going to do a road ride sometime in the next few\r\n    weeks. That gave me all the excuse I needed to show my road bike\r\n    some love.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> My 2006 Giant OCR1 has been stellar. I rarely do <em>any</em>\r\n    maintenance on it, and it's been solid through years of steady\r\n    work. (Shimano 105 group.) But for a while now, it's needed some\r\n    attention. Nothing major. Just basic cleaning and maintenance.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> So I started out intending to just replace the chain and shifter\r\n    cables, but once I'd gone that far it seemed like a good idea to\r\n    get the rear derailleur cleaned out. And then I finally just\r\n    decided to pull the cassette apart and give it a deep cleaning.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Now it's looking shiny and I can't wait to take it for a shake-out\r\n    ride.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    "intro": "<p> The story of this year's Santiago race isn't much of a story. I\r\n    was never in the hunt for a podium spot, and only ever\r\n    slid <em>backward</em> in the pack. About two minutes in, I\r\n    realized I had no idea whether I was in last place or not, and\r\n    decided just to ride my own race. And that's what I did for the\r\n    next couple of hours. (Official finish time: 1:40:50.1.)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Just looking at the race itself, I did not have a good day. But\r\n    comparing against where I was a year ago, I had a <em>great</em>\r\n    day.\r\n</p>",
    "body": "\r\n\r\n<h3>Evidence of Progress</h3>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Wrenching</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Over the last year, I went from going to my local bike shop for\r\n    nearly everything, to <a href=\"archive/3249\">replacing bearings in\r\n    my rear hub</a>, <a href=\"archive/3302\">replacing my entire drive\r\n    train</a>, and mounting tubeless tires. (It's a little thing, but\r\n    still takes a little skill to get done without wasting a\r\n    half-dozen CO2 cannisters).\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Race Routine</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Two days after the hardest ride I've done this year, I\r\n    feel <em>fine</em>. No lingering soreness, no \"Dear God what have\r\n    I done?\" fatigue or anything like that. Feels like just another\r\n    ride. I warmed up relatively well (15 min. of easy pedaling on\r\n    Great Egret trail with a couple of jumps), and immediately after\r\n    the race I spun for another 15 min. or so, then walked a little,\r\n    then ate a banana, a PRO bar, and finished a liter of coconut\r\n    water. Once I got home, I drank several liters of liquids of\r\n    various types, following my old rule: <em>Keep drinking until you\r\n    pee twice.</em>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Bike Skills</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> This is the big one. Saturday's course included a stretch that\r\n    until about four months ago, I was afraid to\r\n    ride. I <a href=\"archive/3296\">worked up to it</a>, and now love\r\n    that little stair-step section at the top of Chutes.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> That's a <em>huge</em> step forward for me. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> So you put all that together, and Saturday's race demonstrated\r\n    pretty significant growth as a rider. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Lessons from the Race</h3>\r\n\r\n<p> As always, I'm trying to learn what I can from every race. Here's\r\n    what I'm taking away from this one.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>The Start is Critical</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I arrived on the start line at the last minute, and decided to be\r\n    polite. I lined up at the back of my category. I got stuck behind\r\n    traffic heading into the first bit of singletrack, and ended up at\r\n    the back of the pack, riding through a dust storm (total white-out\r\n    at one point) up Willow/Egret.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> And there was no reason for any of that. The race data shows\r\n    I <em>could</em> have matched the leaders' pace from the start to\r\n    the dam. I would have avoided a lot of wasted energy braking and\r\n    accellerating on the singletrack, and sucking down dust on the\r\n    fire road.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I'm starting to get my head around the fact that even if my goals\r\n    are modest, a solid start is key to having a good day.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p> <b>I'm Too Fat</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Browsing through the race day photos, there's a clear difference\r\n    between me and the mid-pack Sport riders. They are noticeably\r\n    leaner than I am. Normally, I wouldn't care. But that's reinforced\r\n    by the race data.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I can only imagine what I'd be able to do if I were riding more\r\n    consistently, and not carrying around a gallon of ice cream and\r\n    two batches of cookies everywhere I go.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> It's time to face the fact that the single best thing I can do for\r\n    my cycling (and probably my health in general) is to drop 10-15\r\n    lbs.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>The Race Cannot Be Your Hardest Ride</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> The biggest problem with my race was simply that I wasn't in shape\r\n    for it. It was by far the toughest ride I've done in the last 6\r\n    months or so.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Never again will I go into a race this short (15 miles, 2500\r\n    ft. of climbing) without having done similar rides many times in\r\n    training.\r\n</p>\r\n"

I feel like I have a decent shot at achieving that.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> The race lineup was posted this week, and I feel like there are\r\n    4-5 guys who are right around my level. I'm certainly not much\r\n    stronger than I was at Aliso, and I'm hoping they're not\r\n    either. If they've all been doing Over the Hump, I'm screwed.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> So today the bike got one final tune-up. A general cleaning, fresh\r\n    Stan's in the tires, and a clean & lubed drive train. I also\r\n    removed the rear water bottle, which should make me 0.04 seconds\r\n    faster. So if I win by 0.03 seconds, we'll all know it's because\r\n    I'm fast <em>and</em> smart.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Monday and Wednesday I'll do shake-out rides to stay loose and\r\n    flush out any lurking problems with the bike, and then we'll see\r\n    just how old I got this year.\r\n</p>\r\n",
    "body": "<p> <b>Gear Notes</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Chain:</b> I <em>love</em> the KMC chain. Their \"missing link\"\r\n    setup makes it incredibly easy to pop the chain on &amp; off the\r\n    bike, which makes cleaning and lubricating that much easier. It\r\n    also hasen't exploded on me, which is nice.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Shifters:</b> My new SLX shifters are awesome. Light action,\r\n    crisp shifting. I especially like being able to <em>push</em> the\r\n    release triggers with my thumbs. Sounds like a little thing, but\r\n    there are plenty of spots on local trails (and trails everywhere,\r\n    I assume) where I'm braking hard <em>and</em> need to drop to the\r\n    bottom ring. This lets me do that: index finger on the brake,\r\n    thumb shifting down a ring. No more \"quick let go of the brake to\r\n    shift then hope I grab it again in time to make this turn and\r\n    start cranking up a 20% lead-in.\" It's just \"Yep. Transition\r\n    time. Hit the thumb.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Fork:</b> I'm finally at the point where I <em>hate</em> my old\r\n    Marzocchi fork. It's just horrible. I'm so done with it. I was\r\n    standing up to climb a short hill, and the bike was bobbing all\r\n    over the place, and I thought, \"I should hit the lockout.\" I\r\n    reached down and <em>it was already locked out</em>. Feh. And it\r\n    doesn't help that a comparable Fox fork is about 1200g\r\n    lighter, <em>and</em> has a real lockout, <em>and</em> can be\r\n    upgraded with a remote lockout, <em>and</em> performs far\r\n    better, <em>and</em> is easier to maintain.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Drink Mix:</b> I really wanted to try some CarboRocket 333 for\r\n    this race. But I screwed up. I couldn't get the CR333 in time for\r\n    Saturday's ride, so I just ordered some Skratch mix, which then\r\n    didn't arrive in time for Saturday's ride. Once again, the moral\r\n    to the story is to order as soon as you know what you need.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Every Bit Helps:</b> I removed the back bottle cage from my\r\n    bike (61g), and I'll leave my saddle bag behind for the\r\n    race. Total savings: ~550g. \r\n</p>\r\n"

Sold.  (Plus, I had a new ZTR freehub waiting to go\r\n    on. Sweet!)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I spent much of the weekend setting it up.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n",

I'm sure I'll finish in half the time if I ever\r\n    need to do it again.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Now, when you're fitting the chain, do <em>not</em> screw up\r\n    Shimano's little \"master pin\" thing. I managed to somehow get the\r\n    angle wrong in my chain tool, and it broke <em>before</em>\r\n    actually going into the chain.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> So, I just popped apart the next link, and then joined the chain\r\n    ends using <em>that</em> pin. The join was a little stiff, but a\r\n    few spins of the cranks seemed to show that everything was in\r\n    order.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> And then this morning, I learned why that was a bad idea. (Or, at\r\n    least, I learned that I don't yet have the skill to pull off that\r\n    little maneuver.) Luckily, the chain broke relatively close to the\r\n    trailhead. But now I know: don't screw up that master pin.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I've replaced the shimano chain (which I had to assume was beyond\r\n    repair) with a KMC. We'll see how that goes.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Other than that, though (which is 100% my own fault), the new\r\n    drive train is <em>badass</em>. It was a snap to set up, the\r\n    action on the levers is super-light, and it shifts beautifully\r\n    every time. It feels <em>incredibly</em> solid. Deore\r\n    really <em>has</em> come a long way in the last few years. (My old\r\n    drive train came stock on my bike 4 years ago.)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> At this point, the only components on my bike that I haven't\r\n    swapped out myself are the cockpit, the fork, and the bottom\r\n    bracket. Everything else is new. I'm accumulating enough\r\n    components that it's reasonable to pick up a $100 garage sale bike\r\n    and be able to set it up as a jalopy.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Gear Notes</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Freehub:</b> The new ZTR freehub is <em>awesome</em>. Steel,\r\n    same weight as the old aluminum one (90g), with a spline pattern\r\n    that matches the shimano cassette pattern. Should last\r\n    a <em>lot</em> longer than the last.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Front Derailleur:</b> The groupset I ordered included the M615\r\n    (topswing) derailleur. I need the M616 (downswing). But I got\r\n    lucky-- the chainring spacing is the same as on my old tripple (or\r\n    close enough anyway), so I can make due with my old derailleur\r\n    until the correct one arrives next week.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>ESI Grips:</b> I replaced my thin \"racer's edge\" ESI grips with\r\n    \"Chunky\" ones, and I like it. I'm still getting used to the\r\n    difference, but I think I'm going to like it.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Chain:</b> I decided that my chain was beyond saving, and\r\n    headed for the bike shop for a new one. I ended up spending $50 on\r\n    a KMC X10 10-speed chain. I don't yet know how it performs, but\r\n    the \"missing link\" tool-free installation already puts it way\r\n    ahead of Shimano on the mechanical front.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Multitool:</b> When my chain broke, I wouldn't have had to walk\r\n    half an hour back to the trailhead if my multitool had included a\r\n    chainbreaker. I even had a spare missing link with me that I could\r\n    have used. So, I'm going to find a small multitool with a chain\r\n    tool. Another lesson learned.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n"

My target time was 45:00. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Final time: 48:17.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> That's not good. Worse: I was pretty cooked. The Santiago race\r\n    is <em>two</em> laps.

Judging from last year's finishing times, that puts\r\n    me near the back of the pack.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> That's enough for me to feel a little panic start to creep in. I\r\n    haven't been training like this to finish last.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I have <em>eight weeks</em> to build a faster pace, and build the\r\n    endurance I need for two laps. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> This is where I either have faith that my training plan will work,\r\n    or I panic and just \"ride hard\" for the next few weeks, and end up\r\n    shelled on race day, rolling in DFL and wondering what the hell\r\n    happened.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I have to remember that I'm working a different kind of training\r\n    plan. An <em>explicitly, intentionally experimental</em> plan.

I don't plan to do any racing next\r\n    year (plenty of other stuff should be taking up my time), so I\r\n    have plenty of time to play the long game, build general fitness,\r\n    and pivot back to mountain biking in 2018.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> But the experiment continues: How to finish mid-pack while\r\n    training just 3hrs/wk.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> But I had a nice thought the other night: even if Santiago doesn't\r\n    go well, I still have Caspers in four months. \r\n</p>\r\n",

    "body": "<p> I really\r\n    enjoyed <a href=\"http://fourhourworkweek.com/2016/05/09/the-secrets-of-gymnastic-strength-training/\">Tim\r\n    Ferriss's talk with former U.S. Olympic Gymnastics Coach\r\n    Christopher Sommer</a>. There is <em>deep</em> knowledge there.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Coach Sommers talked about incorporating a period\r\n    of <em>deloading</em> into your training, either by backing off\r\n    the load or volume, <em>or</em> by simply staying at a given load\r\n    long enough that it starts to feel too easy.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> And he talked about coaching an athlete to a world championship,\r\n    during which time he <em>did not change the strength workout at\r\n    all</em>. The trainee simply took less and less time to complete\r\n    the workout as he adapted to the load. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Those thoguhts dovetailed nicely with something I first saw\r\n    in <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Kettlebell-Simple-Sinister-Pavel-Tsatsouline-ebook/dp/B00GF2HP9G/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&ie=UTF8&qid=1466440596&sr=1-1&keywords=simple+and+sinister\">Pavel\r\n    Tsatsouline's book</a>. The idea is that you start with a weight\r\n    that you can handle with difficulty, and over time develop the\r\n    strength and skill to <em>master</em> that weight. For heavy\r\n    kettlebells, this might take <em>months</em> working with the same\r\n    weight. There's a ton of really interesting stuff packed into that\r\n    simple idea. For now, it suffices to say that this leverages the\r\n    body's natural feedback loops to optimize periodization, which\r\n    is <em>awesome</em>.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> So, for my last training block, I picked weights that were tough,\r\n    and stuck with those <a href=\"archive/3296\">same loads</a>, even\r\n    as they felt progressively easier. I did that for three weeks,\r\n    then did a back-off week. (When Dan John, Mark Rippetoe, Joe\r\n    Friel, and now Christopher Sommer all say the same thing, it is\r\n    wise to listen.)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> And now I'm stepping up to a new, more difficult workout. Here's\r\n    the new deal:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n    <p> <b>Warmup</b>\r\n    </p>\r\n    <ul>\r\n        <li>KB swing x 20 @ 35# </li>\r\n        <li>KB swing x 20 @ 50# </li>\r\n        <li>1-arm swing x 20 @ 35#</li>\r\n    </ul>\r\n\r\n    <p> <b>3 Rounds</b>\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <ul>\r\n        <li>KB squat x 12 @ 85#</li>\r\n        <li>push-up x 8 @ BW</li>\r\n    </ul>\r\n\r\n    <p> <b>3 Rounds</b>\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <ul>\r\n        <li>standing row x 12 @ 65#</li>\r\n        <li>flutter kicks x 45</li>\r\n    </ul>\r\n\r\n    <p> <b>3 Rounds</b>\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <ul>\r\n        <li>KB waiter walk 6 x ~40m @ 35# (once each arm)</li>\r\n    </ul>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p> The key difficulty upgrades are the KB squats, flutter kicks, and\r\n    waiter walks. It's all stuff I <em>can</em> do, but it's hard. The\r\n    plan is to do this same workout until I feel ready for the next\r\n    step up, and then I repeat the process.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> It's going to take a while to get to the point where this workout\r\n    is <em>too easy</em>. At the moment, it's <em>perfect</em>,\r\n    pushing my limits without being crazy. Once I feel solid doing\r\n    this, I'll start increasing the reps until I can crank out sets of\r\n    20. Then I'll hold until that feels too easy, and then it's time\r\n    for another step up.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I honestly don't know yet what I'll step up <em>to</em>. Time\r\n    constraints mean I can't add volume, so I'm focused on more\r\n    challenging movements. So I'm going to dive back\r\n    into <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004XIZN5M/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1\">Convict\r\n    Conditioning</a>\r\n    and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Kettlebell-Simple-Sinister-Pavel-Tsatsouline-ebook/dp/B00GF2HP9G\">Simple\r\n    and Sinister</a> and see what I can find. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I'm also paying more attention to stretching and mobility, another\r\n    insight that's been repeated by everyone from Gray Cook to Dan\r\n    John to Christopher Sommer. When the best minds in the world all\r\n    say the same thing, I'd be a fool not to listen.

    "body": "<p> <b>Mental Training</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Above is a video I took rolling the top of Chutes. I'm kind of\r\n    proud of it, as getting comfortable on that was a bit of a\r\n    project, training up my mental fortitude rather than my physical\r\n    strength.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I started by consciously improving my skills on trails I'd already\r\n    ridden. That built skill and confidence. I then took on some new\r\n    challenges on trails that I had <em>not</em> ridden yet. This got\r\n    me comfortable with the mental landscape of rolling into something\r\n    new that I was <em>slightly</em> intimidated by, but confident I\r\n    could do.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Once I'd done that, I worked Chutes itself. I used an old tool\r\n    from music school: I broke the section down into mangeable chunks,\r\n    and took them individually. It took about 20 minutes to work\r\n    through each piece and finally link them together.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Foot Pain</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> No more foot pain. Replacing the bolts in my shoes with shorter\r\n    ones did the trick. Lesson learned: when something hurts, check\r\n    for the cause <em>immediately</em>. I suffered needlessly for\r\n    months because I figured it would go away by itself.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Race Baseline</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Last weekend I rode a lap on the the course for\r\n    the <a href=\"http://nondotadventures.com/home/races/oaks/\">Santiago\r\n    Oaks Race</a> in September. The data is little crazy. My time from\r\n    the bottom of Goat all the way around to the top of Coachwhip\r\n    is <em>one second ahead</em> of what it was nine months ago.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Matching last year's race-pace effort on a solo ride where I\r\n    backed off occasionally, and intentionally overgeared the major\r\n    climbs is good. And doing that at a point in my training cycle\r\n    where I'm doing consistent barbell work (which always makes me\r\n    slower) is even better.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> But I was pretty well cooked after just one lap. I'm going to have\r\n    to ramp up my endurance if I'm going to improve my results\r\n    over <a href=\"archive/3256\">Aliso</a>.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> But first I'm concentrating on <em>faster</em>. My (ambitious)\r\n    target lap time is 40:00. I think that's <em>potentially</em>\r\n    doable, <em>if</em> I train right. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Training</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I'm doing my best to ride three hours and do two gym workouts each\r\n    week. I'm taking a page out\r\n    of <a href=\"http://fourhourworkweek.com/2016/05/09/the-secrets-of-gymnastic-strength-training/\">Christopher\r\n    Sommer's</a> book and let my body truly adapt <em>before</em>\r\n    stepping up to heavier loads. The general plan is four weeks at\r\n    each weight, rather than steadily increasing each week and doing a\r\n    back-off week. Here's the workout:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n    <p> Warm up with 20 KB swings, then 20 one-arm KB swings, and some\r\n        goblet squats if I'm feeling tight.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p> Three rounds:\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <ul>\r\n        <li>deadlift x 12 @ 135#</li>\r\n        <li>push-up x 8 @ BW</li>\r\n    </ul>\r\n\r\n    <p> Three rounds:\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <ul>\r\n        <li>bent-over row x 12 @ 75#</li>\r\n        <li>flutter kicks x 45</li>\r\n    </ul>\r\n\r\n    <p> Then KB waiter walks x 20m @ 35#\r\n    </p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p> I'm feeling steadily stronger on the bike, and the weight work\r\n    feels easier and easier. Once it feels <em>too</em> easy, I'll\r\n    step up to a heavier load and start again.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n"

    "intro": "<p> <b>Finally: The Top of Chutes</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> The race coming up in September will include the Chutes Ridgeline\r\n    trail, so I took the same approach to Chutes that I did\r\n    to <a href=\"archive/3245\">Rock-It</a>. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Rock-It was physically challenging. That's not Chutes. The top of\r\n    Chutes is entirely a mental challenge. So I trained the mental\r\n    aspect. I built up my confidence by mastering sections of trail\r\n    that previously intimidated me, and finally headed up to Chutes\r\n    and took the Music School approach: I broke the section into three\r\n    parts, and mastered each part individually before putting them\r\n    together.\r\n</p>\r\n",
    "body": "<p> <b>Foot Pain &amp; Cleats</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> A few weeks ago, I noticed a nagging pain in my left foot after a\r\n    couple of bike rides. Classic cyclist pain: right over the cleat.\r\n    It was minor, and faded quickly, so I didn't really think too much\r\n    about it. I chalked it up to all the walking I did while my wife\r\n    and I were on vacation.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> But the pain grew, and on Saturday I noticed it after lifting\r\n    weights in the garage. (I lift barefoot, and walking barefoot on\r\n    hard surfaces had previously <em>helped</em> the pain go away.)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> So I got my shoes on the workbench. Long story short: the bolts\r\n    used to secure the cleats were about 2mm too long, and were\r\n    slightly deforming the interior sole of the shoe. I think the\r\n    insole protected me when it was new, but now that it's a couple\r\n    years old, and pretty compacted, it's not doing much.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I dug up some shorter bolts that don't warp the sole. My foot\r\n    pain hasn't magically disapeared, but it's noticeably better.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>New Saddle Bag: Seatsleev</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I had to toss an expensive pair of bib shorts because the strap on\r\n    my saddle bag got old and crusty and eroded the inner\r\n    thighs. I <s>have</s> had two pairs of those bibs, and they're the\r\n    best bibs I've ever owned. <em>But</em>... I'm not happy that they\r\n    didn't cope well with the friction. All my other shorts\r\n    show <em>some</em> signs of wear, but have\r\n    lasted <em>years</em>. These gave up the ghost after about four\r\n    months.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> So I replaced my mountain bike's old saddle bag with\r\n    a <a href=\"http://www.speedsleev.com/product/ballistic-nylon-seatsleev-large-2/\">Seatsleev</a>,\r\n    which has no strap around the seat tube, so my bibs are henceforth\r\n    safe. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> The Seatsleev itself is pretty great. There are a couple things\r\n    I'd change about it, but it's <em>still</em> the best saddle bag\r\n    out there. Holds everything I need in a compact, secure bundle\r\n    that stays out of the way.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Training: Hitting the Weights</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I'm listening to Tim Ferris talk with former US national team\r\n    gymnastics\r\n    coach <a href=\"http://fourhourworkweek.com/2016/05/09/the-secrets-of-gymnastic-strength-training/\">Christopher\r\n    Sommer</a>. Sommer said something that I'm trying to take to\r\n    heart: <em>If you want to be a stud later, you have to be a pud\r\n    now.</em>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> So I'm trying to let go of being fast on the bike for every ride,\r\n    and instead focus on long-term gains in strength and muscular\r\n    endurance. I've dialed back the weights until I can complete all\r\n    the reps with correct form, and I'm addressing my mobility\r\n    issues. (Hamstrings, calves, shoulders.)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Exploration</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> The Agoura/Simi area of southern California is\r\n    positively <em>stuffed</em> with excellent trails within a few\r\n    minutes of my route to/from work. Parks and trails are sprinkled\r\n    around, and I could pick from dozens of great 60- to 90-minute\r\n    rides.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> My new digs in Orange County don't offer that kind of\r\n    luxury... that I know of yet. So I'm making it a point to go and\r\n    explore as much as I can. For a long time, I've ridden on my lunch\r\n    hour and before/after work. I think that I'm going to end up\r\n    making a weekend ride part of my routine so that I get to go ride\r\n    somewhere new on a regular basis. I don't want to arrive five\r\n    years from now having stacked up a thousand rides at Santiago\r\n    Oaks.\r\n</p>\r\n"

    "intro": "<p> Starting a new job is kind of like the first few weeks of a new\r\n    semester as a student: there's no <em>technical</em> reason that\r\n    starting classes should vaccuum up all your time, but it happens\r\n    anyway.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I haven't been riding as much as I'd like, or in as many places as\r\n    I'd like, but I've been riding <em>enough</em>.  There's nothing\r\n    subtle about the lesson from <a href=\"archive/3256\">Aliso</a>: I\r\n    need to get faster across the board. So the general plan is to do\r\n    a six-week hypertrophy cycle, then work muscular endurance for\r\n    another six weeks. Rides will focus on force production when I'm\r\n    fresh, and skills work when I'm not.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I did my first clean run\r\n    down <a href=\"https://www.strava.com/segments/8587548?filter=overall\">Peralta\r\n    Hills</a> on Wednesday, which feels good. And I've been forcing\r\n    myself up a gear on the climbs, trading actual speed for some work\r\n    on force production.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> But the <em>real</em> adjustment that needs to happen is to get\r\n    back in the weight room. So that's what I'm doing. Yesterday was a\r\n    \"back to basics\" day: \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>deadlift 3 x 12 @ 135#</li>\r\n    <li>push-up x 8 @ BW</li>\r\n    <li>bent row x 12 @ 65#</li>\r\n    <li>Russian twist x 20 @ 25#</li>\r\n    <li>leg lift x 20 @ BW</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p> Today, I'm sore, which is testament to how much I need to get back\r\n    in the weight room regularly. I've let it slide\r\n    since <a href=\"archive/3241\">February</a>, so it's been nearly\r\n    four months since I did any real lifting. It shows.\r\n</p>\r\n",

    "intro": "<p> I've been making the most of my remaining time working in Agoura,\r\n    making sure I do all my favorite rides while I still can.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Last Monday, I did my favorite lunchtime dirt loop out through\r\n  Malibu Creek State Park, and was treated to an up-close bobcat\r\n  sighting along the Grasslands trail.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Wednesday, I did a section of the Millennium Loop that I've only\r\n  ridden a few times. I'm <em>really</em> tempted to take some time\r\n  next Friday to ride the full Millennium Loop.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> And yesterday I took another stab at posting a new PR on\r\n    Bulldog. Unfortunately, I knew about 20 minutes in that I wasn't\r\n    going to make it. My average speed was 0.1 mph slower than it\r\n    needed to be, and it was only going to get slower from there. But\r\n    I decided to fight the good fight, and at least get under 40\r\n    minutes. But that got away from me, too. Final time: 41:11, almost\r\n    exactly the same as my last ride up Bulldog, 41:06.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I have <a href=\"archive/3184\">fought battles like this before</a>,\r\n    and I haven't figured out how to win. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> My general strategy for the summer: get my weight under 175 lbs,\r\n    and get in the gym to build peak power output and muscular\r\n    endurance. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "intro": "<p> <a href=\"archive/3254\">Plan A</a> was to conserve energy on the\r\n    initial run-up, use the climbs to secure a mid-pack position, and\r\n    then tear up the final flat back to the finish.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> So I was happy to hear the race director ask that the segment from\r\n    the start to Wood Canyon be a neutral roll-out. Everyone seemed on\r\n    board with that plan, so I didn't struggle to keep up, but I\r\n    started to worry when I noticed that my HR was already 170. Either\r\n    it was adrenaline, or I'd have to back off at some point.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I started sliding back in the pack pretty quickly once we reached\r\n    the Wood Canyon Trail. The pace picked up substantially, and I\r\n    ultimately had to accept that if I wanted to have the legs for\r\n    Cholla and Mathis, I'd have to let them go.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> After that, my race was mostly a solo time trial.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> But I did everything I came to do. I finished with the pack\r\n    (<a href=\"http://replaytiming.com/2016-occ-2/\">Final result: 16th\r\n        of 18</a>), rode a strong race (for me), and I feel like I used\r\n    well the skills I've gained in the last few months.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> That's a good day in my book.\r\n</p>\r\n",
    "body": "<h3>Lessons from Past Races</h3>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I got my bike maintenance in order, got a solid warm-up, and\r\n    avoided going out too hot, or redlining at the start of the\r\n    climbs. So I feel like I avoided repeating past mistakes.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Training Results</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Training in the Morning</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> This <em>definitely</em> helped. At the 7:30 AM race start, I felt\r\n    completely awake, warmed up, and ready to ride. Entirely different\r\n    from how I felt at Whiting Ranch.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Climbing</b> \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I can't even imagine what yesterday would have been like had I not\r\n    put in the time climbing. I needed every bit of endurance and\r\n    recovery that I gained from those workouts. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Skills</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> The <a href=\"archive/3242\">skills work</a>\r\n    and <a href=\"archive/3253\">pre-riding the course</a> made\r\n    a <em>huge</em> difference. I was totally comfortable on Rock-It,\r\n    which feels really good considering that just a few months ago\r\n    there were bits of this trail I was scared to do <em>at all</em>.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I'm a stronger, better rider because I decided to do these\r\n    races. Six months ago, I would have struggled to complete the\r\n    course. Yesterday, I had a fun morning of racing, and will be back\r\n    next year to ride the whole course clean.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Where to Go from Here</h3>\r\n\r\n<p> As expected, this race served primarily as a chance to get my\r\n    bearings as to where I sit in the Sport class. Answer: At the\r\n    back.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> As <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jockowillink\">Jocko</a> would say:\r\n    GOOD. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> That makes it clear that I need to pick up <em>minutes</em>,\r\n    not <a href=\"archive/2885\">seconds</a>. Short answer: drop 12 lbs,\r\n    hit the weights, improve cornering &amp; technical skills.)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> But I have a few <a href=\"archive/3255\">other things</a> on my\r\n    mind for the next couple of weeks.

    "intro": "<p> Changes are afoot, and my cycling life will soon be centered\r\n  around Orange County rather than the inland foothills of the Santa\r\n  Monicas. In many ways, the trails have been my home just as much as\r\n  any apartment or house, and I'm not sure when I'll get to ride them\r\n  again.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> So I'm going to do three things.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>1. Races around the Santa Monicas</h2>\r\n\r\n<p> I'm going to make sure I do a mountain bike race or two each year\r\n  in the Santa Monicas. I'm not even sure if such races exist, but I'm\r\n  going to find them if they do. Might be a proper MTB race. Might be\r\n  a <a href=\"http://www.philsfondo.com/\">Gran Fondo</a>,\r\n  or <a href=\"http://socalcross.org/events/corriganville-cx/\">CX\r\n  race</a>.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>2. The Bucket List</h2>\r\n\r\n<p> I'm putting together a \"Bucket List\" of trails I want to\r\n  enjoy over the next few weeks before Orange County really becomes\r\n  the center of my cycling world.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Johnson Fire Rd.</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Johnson and I have <a href=\"archive/3184\">unfinished\r\n    business</a>. I want to take one last real shot at\r\n  climbing <a href=\"https://www.strava.com/segments/662718\">Johnson's\r\n    Fire Rd</a> in under 30 minutes.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Bulldog</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I'd really like to make my last run up Bulldog for a while a\r\n  PR. That means topping my current best of 38:56.  I've climbed\r\n  Bulldog twice in the last few weeks, and I feel like a PR is a\r\n  possibility. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>New Millennium Loop</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> More unfinished business. I tried this loop on a hot day years\r\n  ago, and bailed before the last climb. I really want to go back and\r\n  do the loop properly. It's been on my list for ever, and I don't\r\n  know when I'll get another chance.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Runkle Cyn</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I've never once managed to climb Runkle clean. There's\r\n  a <a href=\"https://www.strava.com/segments/10764220\">particular\r\n    spot</a> that always gets me. It sets you up with burning legs, and\r\n  once you're climbing at your limit, the whole trailbed turns to\r\n  loose, baseball-sized gravel. I'd like to get one more run up that\r\n  climb, set a new PR, and get it clean. No pressure.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>3. Welcome to O.C.</h2>\r\n\r\n<p> I think whatever melancholy I may feel at not riding my home\r\n  trails much any more, I'm thrilled to be moving to a place where\r\n  mountain bike <em>racing</em> seems to, well, to <em>exist</em>.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I've enjoyed having Bulldog as my \"big climb\" benchmark for the\r\n  last few years. I need something in O.C. to take its place.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <a href=\"https://www.strava.com/segments/8558521\">Coal Canyon</a>\r\n  fits the bill nicely. Time to get out there and see what's up.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <a href=\"https://www.strava.com/segments/608999\">Blackstar\r\n    Canyon</a> might also be a great local challenge, and I'm\r\n    intrigued to\r\n    try <a href=\"https://www.strava.com/segments/1023456\">Harding\r\n    Truck Trail</a>: 9.1 miles at 6% average grade. Could be\r\n    a <em>huge</em> challenge. The KOM is listed at 53:17, so my time\r\n    would likely be near 2 hours. That's a <em>long</em> climb.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> And I'm having a blast using the OC Classic races as an excuse to\r\n  explore. I want to start from that, and branch out to explore the\r\n  trails around Laguna Beach this summer. (I'm told they're the spot\r\n  to escape summer heat. We'll see!)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> And I'm going to make a point of using free weekend mornings to\r\n  come back and ride a few old favorites from the coastal side of the\r\n  Santa Monicas. In particular, I really want to return to Corral\r\n  Canyon, which I did <a href=\"archive/3098\">two summers ago</a>, and\r\n  I <em>really</em> want to\r\n  do <a href=\"http://www.strava.com/segments/616820\">Latigo</a> at\r\n  some point. \r\n</p>\r\n",

This year\r\n  I'm stepping up to Sport, and I'm expecting an education in how\r\n  strong I am <em>not</em>.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> My official race goal is simply to ride well for me, set PRs on\r\n  Cholla and Mathis, and ride Rock-It in smooth, controlled fashion.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> My <em>stretch</em> goal is to finish mid-pack.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> And it may sound strange, but I want to stay mentally clear enough\r\n  to know my position at all times. We'll call this my \"mental goal.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>The Plan</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li> Don't go out too hot. Arrive at the bottom of Cholla at ~160\r\n    BPM, settle into the climb before pushing too hard.\r\n  </li>\r\n  <li> Use Cholla to establish a mid-pack position.\r\n  </li>\r\n  <li> Rip down Rock-It, smooth &amp; steady on the rock garden.\r\n  </li>\r\n  <li> Anticipate the \"Coyote Hump\", walk if I need to.\r\n  </li>\r\n  <li> Start Mathis easy, push the pace after the first 100m. Solidify\r\n    mid-pack position.\r\n  </li>\r\n  <li> Rip Rock-It again, steady through the rock garden again.\r\n  </li>\r\n  <li> <em>EMPTY THE TANK GO GO GO</em>\r\n  </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Tweaks</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I'm going to make sure I get a <a href=\"archive/3249\">good\r\n    warm-up</a>. 20 minutes of steady, easy pedalling. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> This will be a bit longer than past races, and longer than most of\r\n  my training rides. So I'll put Skratch in my bottle to keep me\r\n  fueled.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> And that's about it. I'll do another ride or two this week to keep\r\n  the legs loose, but the focus is really to rest up and hit the\r\n  starging line on Saturday rested &amp; ready.\r\n</p>\r\n"

Great course, perfect day, and lots of\r\n    friendly people. Can't wait to get out there on a closed course\r\n    and let the bike run.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I worried that it might be too much in one week, but decided not\r\n    to miss the chance to pre-ride.

    "intro": "<p> On Saturday, when I realized the grinding from my rear wheel was\r\n    coming from inside the hub, I figured I'd have to take my bike to\r\n    the shop.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> But I <em>really</em> hate having factors outside my control ruin\r\n    my day. And I generally like to <a href=\"archive/2868\">do my own\r\n    wrenching</a>. The more I thought about it, the more I realized\r\n    I'd feel a lot better doing the repairs myself.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> So I pulled my rear hub assembly apart and got to the bottom\r\n    of <a href=\"archive/3248\">what killed my race</a>.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n",
    "body": "<p> I'd originally <a href=\"archive/3248\">guessed it was the\r\n    freehub</a>. But I guessed wrong: the drive side cartridge bearing\r\n    had completely disintegrated. There were a dozen tiny ball\r\n    bearings loose between the freehub pawls &amp; the hub body. Many\r\n    of them were ground down to little flattened hemispheres.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> But, happily, there doesn't seem to be any damage to the axle or\r\n    hub, or even the freehub pawls.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I found\r\n    the <a href=\"http://www.notubes.com/help/a/literature/Hub-Manual.pdf\">manual</a>\r\n    for my hubs, and set about pulling apart and cleaning the whole\r\n    assembly. The hardest part was removing the bearing races from the\r\n    hub and axle. The outer race didn't leave a lot of accessible area\r\n    to get a grip on, and the inner race was pretty well clamped\r\n    around the axle. But ultimately everything came loose with no\r\n    damage.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> New bearings arrived last night, and my improvised bearing press\r\n    (a 10-inch 3/8'' bolt with a nut &amp; some washers) performed\r\n    like a champ. And light traffic this morning let me squeeze in a\r\n    great ride before work. Rear wheel showed no sign of trouble.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> (I'm holding off putting on the new freehub until I'm sure the new\r\n    bearing fixed the whole problem. I don't want my brand new freehub\r\n    to end up a casualty if I didn't install everything correctly.)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Feels good. I'm not happy that I DNF-ed a race, but I feel good\r\n    that I didn't just say, \"Well, shit happens,\" and drop my bike at\r\n    the shop. It feels good to take ownership of the issue, learn\r\n    something and become a better mechanic.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> And I don't want to let the learning stop there.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Warm-Up</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I'm relearning that it takes me forever to get all cylinders\r\n    firing on early, cold mornings. For Aliso, I'm going to make sure\r\n    I get 15-20 minute of steady pedalling before the race.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Race Strategy</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I made the classic mistake: I went out too fast, and ended up with\r\n    my heart rate pinned on the way up Dreaded. Once I was on the\r\n    climb, it simply wasn't possible to get my HR under control. The\r\n    result is that I pushed my HR from a Z4, threshold pace to a\r\n    Z5c <em>anaerobic</em> pace for just a seven-second gain over my\r\n    \"take-it-easy\" time.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Aliso has a similar start: flat, then a steep hill. I'll do it\r\n    right this time. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I also feel like I didn't warm up well. At Aliso, I'll get 10-20\r\n    minutes of steady pedaling.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Maintenance</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I'm going to check the bearings in the front hub to make sure\r\n    they're in good order. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> My fork is (over)due for an overhaul. That's going to happen\r\n    before the next race. (And it'll happen at the shop-- I don't yet\r\n    have the know-how to do that job right, and it's a big job.)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Spare Wheels</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> One of the other racers actually offered me his rear wheel so I\r\n    could at least finish. That was <em>incredibly</em> nice of him,\r\n    and it reminded me that I have my <em>own</em> spare set of\r\n    wheels: the stock wheels that came with my bike. I'm tempted to\r\n    put them together with an old cassette and tires, and just have\r\n    them ready for the next race. Might be overkill, but it's\r\n    something to think about.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Training</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I feel like my training got <em>completely</em> derailed over the\r\n    last couple of weeks. I felt slow on Saturday, all mishaps aside,\r\n    and I was sluggish on my lunchtime road ride yesterday. (About a\r\n    minute behind PR pace on\r\n    the <a href=\"https://www.strava.com/segments/405497 \">climb up\r\n    Mulholland</a>.) I felt better this morning, and I'm going to make\r\n    sure that I'm climbing strong and pinning my HR on a regular\r\n    basis.\r\n</p>\r\n"

And then my freehub started grinding a couple minutes up\r\n    Dreaded Hill. I called it at the second turn, babied it back to\r\n    the finish line, let the timing crew know to mark me DNF, and\r\n    headed for home.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> The irony is that a new freehub was literally <em>in the\r\n    mail</em>. I ordered it last week. Oh well. Live and learn: I\r\n    have too much time and effort invested to let worn gear torpedo my\r\n    race day.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I'm trying to learn as much as I can from what little time\r\n    I <em>did</em> spend in the saddle. The nutshell: I went out too\r\n    hot.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I hit the bottom of Dreaded with my heart rate already around 170,\r\n    which didn't leave a lot of room to step up my effort, and once I\r\n    started the climb, my HR rose to around 177 and stayed there, no\r\n    matter how much I backed off.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> In the end, I topped my <a href=\"archive/3243\">exploratory,\r\n    easy-pace</a> time to the first turn by just 3 seconds, at a HR\r\n    about 10 BPM highter. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Not a bad way to spend a morning, and I learned a bit (and will\r\n    learn even more when I put my new freehub on), and it was pretty\r\n    cool hanging out for a bit and cheering on the other riders coming\r\n    up Dreaded.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> And this afternoon, after I'd had a chance to clean up and relax a\r\n    little, the new freehub arrived in the mail.\r\n</p>\r\n",

    "intro": "<p> The <a href=\"http://nondotadventures.com/home/races/whiting/\">Whiting\r\n    Ranch Time Trial</a> is coming up on Saturday, which makes this my\r\n    week to rest up. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> But this cycle is a bit weird. I was on vacation last week, so I\r\n    stacked up <a href=\"archive/3246\">two weeks</a> of lots of riding\r\n    before heading out of town, and used the time off to rest &amp;\r\n    recover from that. (My wife and I tend to do <em>lots</em> of\r\n    walking when we're abroad, so I got plenty of \"active rest\"\r\n    activity, which is awesome.)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I got out at lunchtime today to wake up the legs after a week\r\n    off. I'm sure jetlag and general travel weariness played a role,\r\n    but... <em>damn</em>. That hurt more than I thought it would.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I warmed up, then did a few little repeats of a steep 90-second\r\n    hill just to get the legs and lungs fully humming, then cruised\r\n    out to the burrito place and back to work. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I've been here before. Whenever I push hard enough to need a\r\n    back-off week (or two), I feel sluggish and tired for a while. It\r\n    usually takes a short, hard effort to wake everthing back up and\r\n    get me cranking again.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> The plan is to get back in the groove with something short &amp;\r\n    sharp tomorrow, then do an easy spin on Thursday just to keep the\r\n    legs loose for Saturday.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> So... goals for the race.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> The plan is to keep my HR under 170 on Dreaded Hill so that I have\r\n    something left for the climb up Vulture View. I can pin it up the\r\n    last bit of that, and then there's a short flat where I can\r\n    recover a bit before the downhill.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> And then it's all downhill. My goal here is just to ride smoothly\r\n    and under control and carry speed through the corners. I've been\r\n    working on my skills, and I want to focus on applying them under\r\n    pressure. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I've <a href=\"archive/3243\">looked at last year's results</a>, and\r\n    know that a podium finish is <em>really</em> unlikely, so I'm just\r\n    going to aim for a smart &amp; smooth mid-pack finish.\r\n</p>\r\n",

    "intro": "<p> Two awesome weekends of riding. But I've doubled my usual weekly\r\n    saddle time for two weeks in a row, and that party has to end\r\n    sometime. The lack of stoke on Sunday was the give-away that it's\r\n    time to back off and recover. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> So I gave myself a couple of days to rest, then hit Cheeseboro for\r\n  a quick after-work spin out to Shepherd's Flat and back. By the time\r\n  I got back to the car, two things were clear: I\r\n  felt <em>awesome</em>, and my fork was sagging <em>way</em> too\r\n  much.\r\n</p> \r\n\r\n<p> Fork pressure was down to 30 psi, so I topped it back up to 65,\r\n  and I'm back in business. (Though that fork is way overdue for an\r\n  overhaul.)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> And today I rode a quick loop around Weir Canyon. A little over 30\r\n  minutes on the bike. Enough to know that I'm still pretty tired, but\r\n  that I'm coming around. In ten days or so, I'll be stoked to ride,\r\n  and stronger than ever.\r\n</p>",

    "intro": "<p> I had a great day out at Aliso Canyon\r\n  yesterday. My <a href=\"archive/3226\">first ride</a> didn't go too\r\n  well, so it was <em>awesome</em> to flip that around. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I went with a mission: build the skills and line selection knowledge I need to get down Rock-It smoothly, and totally in control.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> So I planned on doing two runs. The first run, I spent plenty of\r\n  time memorizing landmarks and figuring out the best line. I really\r\n  took my time, spending about 25 minutes riding, surveying, and then\r\n  re-riding the spots that gave me trouble. (Very much like my\r\n  old <a href=\"archive/920\">old routine</a> for learning a new piece\r\n  of music.)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> On the second run, I concentrated not on speed, but on staying\r\n  super-smooth and in-control, and on seeing the landmarks, and\r\n  knowing where I was in the sequence. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I'm not sure I really stuck to the <em>best</em> line, but it was\r\n  great to roll the whole thing all the way down, and feel confident\r\n  doing it. And this time out I felt totally confident on the <a href=\"https://www.strava.com/segments/8905869\">up-and-over\r\n  section</a> of Coyote Trail, which\r\n  spooked me the first time I tried it.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> It felt really good to have worked on my downhill skills and have\r\n  it pay off like this. I couldn't help thinking, <em>I'm better at\r\n  this than I used to be.</em>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> This morning I could feel that while I <em>could</em> carry out my\r\n  planned attack on Dreaded Hill today, it would push me into a deep\r\n  recovery cycle I don't want to be in.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p> So I headed out to Weir Canyon, and put in a little\r\n  time <em>concentrating</em> on skills work, but <em>actually</em>\r\n  doing some pretty good power production stuff as well. I worked on\r\n  the connector back to Santiago Oaks, and when I felt done, I headed\r\n  around Deer and back down the connector to the car. All told, I was\r\n  on the trails for maybe 45 minutes. That's <em>far</em> better than\r\n  the 25+ total minutes of climbing Dreaded Hill that I had planned.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Two super-fun days in the saddle. I'm planning on one more big\r\n  ride this week, and then I'll ease back a bit to get ready for the\r\n  Whiting Ranch race on March 19.\r\n</p>\r\n",

    "intro": "<p> On Sunday I decided to check out the route of the\r\n    upcoming <a href=\"http://nondotadventures.com/home/races/whiting/\">Whiting\r\n    Ranch Time Trial</a>. I'm learning (the easy way, thankfully) that\r\n    being familiar with the course is a <em>huge</em> asset on race\r\n    day. I know from <em>years</em> ago that my second run around a\r\n    loop is <em>significantly</em> faster than the first. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <a href=\"https://www.strava.com/segments/611883\">Dreaded Hill</a>\r\n    (seriously, that's its official name on the map and everything)\r\n    wasn't too <em>dread</em>ful. (Har.) I managed to settle into a\r\n    sustainable climbing pace with my heart rate hovering around 168\r\n    bpm, and my legs only <em>mostly</em> burning. This little beast\r\n    starts out with a steep kicker, so the lesson is not to go out too\r\n    hot on this one: set a steady tempo and let my heart rate rise to\r\n    meet it.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> The other lesson: the second climb,\r\n    <a href=\"https://www.strava.com/segments/3433179\">Santiago Ranch\r\n    Rd.</a>, isn't terrible, but it's loose. If my legs are spent, I'm\r\n    going to have a tough time with it. So I have to remember that\r\n    Dreaded Hill isn't the whole battle, and that it's on\r\n    the <em>second</em> climb of the day that I can really\r\n    push. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <a href=\"http://replaytiming.com/2015-occ-1/#251\">Last year's\r\n    results</a> show that all the <i>Sport Men 40-49</i> podium spots were under 22:40. I'm\r\n    sure I won't be anywhere near that. My time for the Strava segment\r\n    was 36:28. I'll do <em>way</em> better than that once I avoid the\r\n    wrong turns, step up my pacing, and lose the fatigue\r\n    from <a href=\"http://dreadedmonkeygod.net/home/\">Saturday's\r\n    training ride</a>, but I'm not sure I'll manage to\r\n    do <em>11&frac12; minutes</em> better. I'll be satisfied if I get\r\n    down around 30:00. I'll be really happy if I get under 28:00. And\r\n    I'll be <em>stunned</em> if I get under 25:00.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> My goals for this race are simply to have fun, ride smooth and\r\n    speedy, and finish mid-pack. We'll see how that goes. The course\r\n    is pretty great. Strong climbing and super-fun singletrack\r\n    downhill. Really looking forward to this. \r\n</p>\r\n",

Slightly higher, slightly more power to the pedals,\r\n    all the usual awesome.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> And after a couple of rides, I noticed my hips hurting. I located\r\n    the trouble in my iliotibial bands.

I've (re)learned that I need at\r\n    least two rest days after a heavy barbell session.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> It's time to pick out workouts for the next Base block. I'm\r\n    targeting \"Muscular Endurance\" and \"Force Production.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> So, it looks like I'll be aiming to maintain a schedule that looks\r\n    something like this:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li> <b>Monday:</b> Moderate Hills: 3 min. @ 6% grade, Zone 4 x 3-5 reps.\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li> <b>Tuesday:</b> Barbell Work: Strength Maintenance\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li> <b>Wednesday:</b> Recovery Ride\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li> <b>Thursday:</b> Tempo: 30 min. @ HR Zone 3\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li> <b>Friday:</b> Moderate Hills: 3 min. @ 6% grade, HR Zone 4 x 3-5 reps.\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p> The challenge here is a strange one. I need to find a moderate\r\n    hill that takes three minutes or more to climb. Around here, hills\r\n    can be short or long, but they're always steep.\r\n</p>\r\n"

    "body": "<p> Most training plans assume I have 8 or more hours a week to\r\n  train. Even Charmichael's <em>Time-Crunched Cyclist</em> requires 8\r\n  or more hours of training each week. That doesn't seem\r\n  very <em>time-crunched</em> to me. Strava's training\r\n  plans <em>start</em> at 10 or more hours a week. I simply don't have\r\n  that kind of time.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Now, to be fair: part of why I can make progress in just four\r\n  one-hour workouts a week is because I am not terribly fit, by badass\r\n  cycling standards. I am fat, weak, and slow; any kind of plan will\r\n  make me less so.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Still, it's nice that there's a serious training guide out there\r\n  that will help me make the absolute best use of the little time I\r\n  have to improve the little fitness I have.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <em>Training Bible</em> allows for my schedule. I typically train\r\n  around 200-300 hours a year, 3-4 hours a week, with the occasional\r\n  spike to 6 hr/wk. <em>Training Bible</em> works with that: the 200\r\n  hr/yr guidelines fall nicely within what I can realistically do.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> The other thing I love: Friel incorporates barbell training into\r\n  the plan, <em>and counts it toward weekly training hours</em>. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> So, last week I started the \"Prep 1\" phase of my training\r\n  year. The basic idea is to lay the groundwork on which I can build\r\n  strength and endurance.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I tweaked Friel's recommended workout a little to suit what tools\r\n  I have available, and I do the workout as a circuit so that I get\r\n  some aerobic benefit as well as building muscle.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n  <p> <b>3 rounds:</b>\r\n  </p>\r\n  <ul>\r\n    <li>squat x 20 @ 55#</li>\r\n    <li>bench row x 20 @ 20#</li>\r\n    <li>Romanian dead lift x 20 @ 55#</li>\r\n    <li>dumbbell chest press x 20 @ 20#</li>\r\n    <li>standing row x 12 @ 55#</li>\r\n    <li>Russian triangle x 20 @ 25#</li>\r\n  </ul>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p> Ideally, I'd be doing 20 reps of each exercise. However, I'm still\r\n  figuring out how to do that in a circuit with a single barbell.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I did this workout the first time on Friday, and it took me until\r\n  today to fully recover.

I'm\r\n  going to see if it's covered under the warranty. If that doesn't\r\n  happen, I'll have some decisions to make, and likely have to wait a\r\n  few months before I'm back on a mountain bike. In the meantime I've\r\n  got my barbells and kettlebells and a road bike, a pair of running\r\n  shoes, and even my old inline skates.

So I took it apart, and got my\r\n    answer.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> This pump is designed such that simple user error can\r\n    cause <em>immediate and permanent damage</em> that makes the pump\r\n    inoperative.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> To use the pump correctly:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n    <li> Twist the handle to select the valve type.</li>\r\n    <li> Press the pump onto the valve.</li>\r\n    <li> Pump to inflate the tire.</li>        \r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p> To destroy your pump and strand yourself:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n    <li> Press the pump onto the valve.</li>\r\n    <li> Twist the handle to select the valve type.</li>\r\n    <li> Doh!</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p> At some point, this is evidently what I did. And in trying to\r\n    figure out what was wrong with the pump, I must have done it some\r\n    more.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> This is truly stupid, and makes me question how Crank Bros. ever\r\n    thought this was a good design. Yes, <em>technically</em>, this\r\n    was user error. But any product that people rely on to get them\r\n    home should survive this kind of user error. And this particular\r\n    error (press then twist vs. twist then press) is exactly the kind\r\n    of thing that users are likely to do when learning how to use the\r\n    pump, or when using the pump for the first time in a long time.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Anyway, I've picked out a new pump (a Lezyne Drive Hv), and have\r\n    added it to my Christmas list. If Santa doesn't bring it, Amazon\r\n    will.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWinter Goals\r\n\r\n<p> I've been reading Maffetone, and I can dig what he's\r\n    about. Cycling <em>does</em> rest on a bedrock of aerobic fitness.\r\n    But for me, long, steady base building rides are a\r\n    non-starter. And weight training is a <em>must</em>. And so,\r\n    though I want to learn all I can, I must for the moment focus on\r\n    what will serve me well in the next year.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> So I've been going back to Joe Friel's <em>The Cyclist's Training\r\n    Bible</em>, which has been <em>excellent</em>. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> The first O.C. Classic Race is in mid-March, which is too early to\r\n    fit in a proper prep/base/build/peak cycle. So I'm scheduling my\r\n    training so that race falls during a recovery week. Instead, I'm\r\n    targeting the second race, at Aliso, as my first peak of the\r\n    season. After that, the rest of the Non Dot series space out\r\n    nicely to allow a build &amp; peak cycle before each race.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Before I can get started, though, I need to know where I am. So\r\n  here are my current measurements:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li><b>Body Weight:</b> 185.5 lbs.\r\n  </li>\r\n  <li><b>Hip:</b> 39''\r\n  </li>\r\n  <li><b>Waist:</b> 37''\r\n  </li>\r\n  <li><b>Chest:</b> 40''\r\n  </li>\r\n  <li><b>Thigh:</b> 23''\r\n  </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p> So the notion is that my thigh, hip, and chest should get bigger,\r\n  while my waist will get smaller.

    "intro": "<p> On Saturday I raced the final race of the Non Dot O.C. Classic\r\n    race series\r\n    at <a href=\"http://nondotadventures.com/home/races/caspers/\">Caspers\r\n        Wilderness Park</a>.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> This time around, I wanted another podium spot, but more\r\n    importantly, I wanted to learn from the first race and make better\r\n    decisions.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> The Strava Flyby of the <a href=\"archive/3216\">Santiago Oaks\r\n        race</a> showed that the winner had gone clear of the pack really\r\n    quickly. I was determined not to miss the jump this time.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n",
    "body": "<p> So, when this race started, I went with the fast guys. The Caspers\r\n    course starts on a nice wide, paved road and there was plenty of\r\n    space, and the rider pushing the pace had lined up right next to\r\n    me. So I quickly dropped in behind him and got pulled along\r\n    behind. All I had to do was stick with the white jersey.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Three of us broke away along the paved road, with me sitting #2. I\r\n    checked my GPS, and my HR was only about 165 bpm, <em>far</em> more\r\n    under control than last time, but I still had my doubts. If White\r\n    Jersey continued to hammer once we started up the ridge, I'd be\r\n    forced to let him go.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Evidently, that's exactly what the rider behind me was\r\n    thinking. He dropped back well before starting the climb, no doubt\r\n    betting that White Jersey and I were going out too hard, and would\r\n    pay the price later.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> As we started the first climb, I kept checking behind us. At first\r\n    I thought I could see a few riders from our division, but we soon\r\n    had what looked like a sizable gap.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> White Jersey was setting an aggressive pace, but I felt like we\r\n    were fairly evenly matched. I stayed on his wheel most of the way\r\n    up the east ridge, content to let him set the tempo.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I knew the rider who'd let us go earlier was right. I knew this\r\n    wouldn't last. I knew I couldn't hold that pace through the second\r\n    lap. I knew I'd fade.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> But I also knew it was a short race. We were nearly done with the\r\n    first of two climbs. And I figured that if he <em>didn't</em> fade,\r\n    then the race would be his regardless. And if he <em>did</em>, I\r\n    wanted to be there to take advantage, if I could.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I was in the lead over the top, and I let the bike run through the\r\n    fork in the trail and onto the downhill. I figured we'd put some\r\n    more time into the riders behind us, and see which of us would\r\n    come out ahead on the second lap up the climb.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> We hit the gravelly downhill hot, and as I started to dial back\r\n    the speed, the rider ahead of me fishtailed. That kicked up enough\r\n    dust that I couldn't get a clear look at the line, and I heard\r\n    brakes behind me, and started to lose traction and swing wide to the\r\n    right, toward a rough-looking rut.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I was going too fast to hold a line <em>inside</em> the rut, so I\r\n    did the only thing I could: I tried to ride the berm that\r\n    was <em>outside</em> the rut. Unfortunately, I ended up too\r\n    upright on the berm and got dumped into the bushes.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> White Jersey pulled around (while checking that I was okay), and I\r\n    took a few seconds to check myself and my bike, and then got back in\r\n    the race.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> White Jersey was <em>gone</em>, man. But I'd been watching the\r\n    riders that passed me, and figured I was still in second place. I\r\n    still had a bit of a gap left behind me, and if White Jersey was\r\n    going to fade, then he was <em>still</em> going to fade, and\r\n    I <em>still</em> wanted to be there when it happened.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> So I kept the pressure on, tried to find fast, smooth riders to\r\n    follow, and ripped as fast as I could down the back stretch and\r\n    through the starting area.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I hustled along the paved road and up the East Ridge Trail again,\r\n    hoping to catch sight of White Jersey and start reeling him in. But\r\n    as I reached the top of the climb up East Ridge, I knew he'd\r\n    probably stay away. The rest of the race was largely downhill, and\r\n    there are just not that many places to press any advantage on the\r\n    back stretch, and I knew I didn't have an advantage anyway.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> So I just tried to make sure nobody caught me. By my counting, I\r\n    was in second, with first nowhere in sight, and third a distant\r\n    straggler behind me. So I just kept an eye out for anyone catching\r\n    up, and pulled for home.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> And then, on the last half mile, I spotted it: a white jersey\r\n    bobbing up a short rise. I cranked with everything I had left, and\r\n    closed the gap.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> As I drew closer, I could see that this might be a different white\r\n    jersey than the one I'd been chasing. And when I got closer still,\r\n    I could see the writing on his calf: \"S3\", for <em>Sport\r\n        (30-39)</em>. Not my division. Rats.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> And just like that, we were into the finishing chute and done. I\r\n    pulled through the corral, exhausted, to take second place.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> White Jersey was standing with his bike right near the finish\r\n    line.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Dude was a class act. Asked if I was okay, and said that it sucked\r\n    that I crashed, because that's not how he wanted to win. I laughed\r\n    and said, \"Dude, this is a <em>mountain bike</em> race. Bike\r\n    handling is part of it!\" He piloted his bike at speed through a\r\n    dicy downhill without crashing, <em>and</em> kept the pressure on\r\n    through the second climb. That's a deserving winner any day.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I discovered at the award ceremony that third place had been taken\r\n    by the rider I'd tried to pass at the end of the previous race. We\r\n    both laughed as we recognized each other. I asked what happened,\r\n    and he said that White Jersey and I had just taken off so fast\r\n    that he decided to let us go. After that, he never saw us again.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> If anything, I feel like all of that validated my decision to stay\r\n    with the leaders from the jump. That's what put me in posision to\r\n    crash and still stay in the race.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> But I also failed to think strategically about the dicy downhill\r\n    where I crashed. I knew we had a gap, and I knew from\r\n    my <a href=\"archive/3216\">pre-ride</a> what the downhill was\r\n    like. Those things afforded me an opportunity to take my time and\r\n    just get through the gravel safely. Instead, I was super-focused\r\n    on pushing the pace and blew my chance to win. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> After looking at\r\n    the <a href=\"http://results.replaytiming.com/Results.aspx?CId=16561&RId=26&EId=3\">official\r\n    times</a> and checking my own data on Strava, it looks like the\r\n    crash cost me about 40 seconds. And White Jersey and I were really\r\n    evenly matched. My first lap was just 38 seconds slower than his,\r\n    and my second lap was just 7 seconds slower. And in the end, I\r\n    finished just 45 seconds out of first place.  Had I kept the\r\n    rubber side down, anything could have happened.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> And that's what happens when you're learning something new: if you\r\n    don't repeat past mistakes, you get to make all new ones.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I had a <em>great</em> time at this race, and ended up talking to\r\n    some really cool people afterward. The folks\r\n    at <a href=\"http://nondotadventures.com/\">Non Dot Adventures</a>\r\n    did an amazing job setting everything up, managing what could have\r\n    been a rough parking situation, and attracting a crowd that's all\r\n    smiles and good conversation. Everyone I talked to wanted to have\r\n    a great race, but they also wanted everyone <em>else</em> to have\r\n    a great race too. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> It really is something special, and I can't wait to line up for\r\n    the first race of 2016.\r\n</p>\r\n"

I laughed out loud\r\n  when I found that Strava's training plan for a <em>10-minute\r\n  climb</em> required <em>5-8 hours</em> a week of cycling. And even\r\n  the most \"crunched\" of the <em>Time Crunched Training Programs</em>\r\n  was around 7 hours per week.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> It just seems that every program assumes you want to <em>win</em>,\r\n  and then tells you how to get there.

Here's how to get the most out of those resources.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I accept that I'm never going to win a race training half as much\r\n  as my competitors.

If I'm fresh, I pick something that'll take an\r\n  hour, with 1,500 of climbing or so, and I push the tempo. If I'm\r\n  feeling not-so-fresh, I keep the climbing under 1,000 ft. And if\r\n  I'm <em>tired</em>, I rest. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Part of keeping all this in balance is being able to feel how much\r\n  I'm really up for. The training I did last fall really helped me\r\n  develop a feel for knowing when to rest and be patient.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I've stacked up a great training week. Two solid rides, and two\r\n  gym sessions that felt the best they ever have. I'll rock this\r\n  rhythm for another week or two, then race on Nov. 14.\r\n</p>\r\n"

Well worth your time. That dude is utterly <em>not f*cking\r\n    around.</em>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Yesterday was rough for various reasons, and last night was\r\n    better, but not a lot. Bad sleep on Sunday night, and far too\r\n    little sleep Tuesday. I had every reason to call today my <em>too\r\n    pooped to pop</em> day.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> But listening to Jocko reminded me that life is short, and that\r\n    come race day it won't matter <em>why</em> I'm weak and slow. I'll\r\n    just be weak and slow. So I got my act together and did my\r\n    afternoon workout.\r\n</p>\r\n",

    "intro": "<p> Going into the race, I had two plans.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Plan A</b>\r\n\r\n<p> Go out fast and get near the front before the first singletrack\r\n    climb (Mountain Goat), then maintain position up Bumblebee, step\r\n    heavy on the gas up Oaks, and burn whatever matches I have left on\r\n    Coachwhip. Get a short rest going down Chutes, then keep it pinned\r\n    all the way to the finish.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Plan B</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I <em>think</em> I can do a 50-minute lap. Judging by last year's\r\n    results, that puts me in shouting distance of the podium. So if I\r\n    find myself sliding back on the first fire road, then the whole\r\n    plan changes. I'll just ride <em>my</em> pace, and pick off riders\r\n    as I can.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> So... yeah. <em>That</em> was my brilliant pan. Plan A is ride\r\n    fast and pass people, and Plan B is... ride not-as-fast and pass\r\n    people.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Bike racing is weird.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Anyway, the only two things I genuinely wanted to avoid:\r\n  mechanical trouble, and wrong turns. Both are stupid, stupid reasons\r\n  to fail at bike racing.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> And I had just one genuine goal for the race: finish my lap in\r\n  under 50:00. I <em>thought</em> I could do it, but I\r\n  wasn't <em>sure</em> at all. I wanted something I could point to and\r\n  say, \"I hit my target time, and had fun. Whatever else happened,\r\n  that's a good day.\"\r\n</p>\r\n",
    "body": "<p> <b>The Play-by-Play</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> There were 11 registered <em>Beginner Men (30-39)</em> riders\r\n  going into the race, and 2 more joined on race day, so the starting line wasn't crowded. And\r\n  everyone seemed to be there just to have fun. Great crowd. At one\r\n  point one of the riders asked about strategy, and we all\r\n  agreed: <em>definitely</em> burn out your legs sprinting off the\r\n  line.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> And then we got the countdown, and the race official yelled, \"GO!\"\r\n  and we were off.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I immediately found myself sliding backward in the pack as we\r\n  zippered into the first short stretch of singletrack, but the pace was\r\n  easy, and I was with the lead group, so I didn't sweat it.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Once we reached the Willow fire road, the group picked up speed\r\n  and we were all cruising along. I was wary of burning out my legs\r\n  too soon, but found myself passing people... <em>easily</em>. I\r\n  decided I'd keep doing it as long as it was just me holding a steady\r\n  pace.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> And then I was in the lead.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I knew it wouldn't last, but I was happy to get to pick my own line\r\n  through the dogleg on Willow. I checked my GPS, which said\r\n  my heart rate was 176, so I made a conscious decision to back off a\r\n  bit. And then we were at the dam, and two or three guys pulled\r\n  around me on the short climb there.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Starting up Mountain Goat,\r\n  I totally lost track of my place in the pack. I figured 4th,\r\n  maybe 5th. We'd caught the back of the <em>Beginners (29-)</em>\r\n  pack, so it got a little tough to see where everybody was. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> (I hadn't yet realized that I can (Duh!) just look at the back of\r\n  everyone's calf to see what category they're in. <em>Beginners\r\n  (29-)</em> had, \"B2\" on their calf. <em>Beginners (30-39)</em> (my\r\n  category) had, \"B3\", and so on.)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Anyway. At the bottom of Bumblebee the guy I was trailing waved me\r\n  around, and I found myself mostly alone. Chasers were maybe 20\r\n  seconds back, and the guys ahead of me were... where? Around a\r\n  switchback somewhere, maybe. No clue. Stick to the plan: push the\r\n  pace here and hope someone ahead fades.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I caught a couple other riders on the top half of Bumblebee, and\r\n  finally got my passing game together: hold the pace, call out \"on\r\n  your left\", and <em>go</em>, decisively, the very minute I was sure\r\n  my pace was stronger than theirs.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I tried to pour on the gas up Oaks Fire Road, but found I was\r\n  already pretty close to my limit. So, I did the mental flip\r\n  into <em>let the legs scream, I don't care</em> mode and did what I\r\n  could. I remembered my <a href=\"archive/3215\">last ride</a>, and\r\n  tried to make the most of the short downhill reprieve on oaks,\r\n  breathing deep and staying off the brakes.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Somewhere in all that, I finally learned to other riders' calves to see what\r\n  category they were in, and I started doing the math. About four guys\r\n  went ahead of me up Goat, I think I passed one, so I <em>might</em> be\r\n  sitting third. Or, y'know... seventh, if my usual <em>ride and do\r\n  math</em> skills held.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Whatever. The guy that was chasing me up Oaks passed hard and made\r\n  a beeline for the Yucca downhill. I figured if he thought the\r\n  downhill was his moment, I'd let him have it, and do my best to\r\n  follow his line.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Turns out his line was good, and my following was okay, because I\r\n  was right behind him starting up Coachwhip. I checked his calf: B4,\r\n  for <em>Beginners (40-49)</em>. Good. I'm not sliding back in my\r\n  category. Still: <em>where the hell are the B3 leaders?</em>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> So I pinned it. At <em>every</em> point where Coachwhip leveled\r\n  out, I'd jump to the middle ring. I found a rhythm: middle for the\r\n  level sections, little ring for the switchies. Minimal fussing with\r\n  the cogs. I stayed on the gas, kept my rhythm, and opend a gap on\r\n  the riders behind me. It was working.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Until it wasn't. I hit the trigger to drop to the little ring\r\n  and... fffffffffffffff. Dropped chain.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I stopped, dismounted, shifted to the middle ring again, and spun\r\n  the pedals. They caught immediately, and I was back on my bike and\r\n  rolling through the next switchback just as the rider behind caught\r\n  me. Not as fast as it <em>could</em> have been, but not a disaster. (The correct method\r\n  for dealing with this is noted <a href=\"#droppedchain\">below</a>.)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I picked the same horrible line down Barham Ridge\r\n  as <a href=\"archive/3214\">last week</a> and nearly wrecked trying to\r\n  pull the <em>Shaolin serenely floating wheels of speed</em>\r\n  maneuver over a totally optional rock garden. I am an idiot.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> The pre-ride served its purpose, though. I knew exactly where the\r\n  turnoff for Chutes was, so took the fork without having to think\r\n  about it. Only the <em>Beginner</em> categories were using this\r\n  trail (the others were routed down the Chutes Ridgeline), which\r\n  was <em>awesome</em>. It cleared away some of the traffic, and I could be reasonably sure that I\r\n  was actually chasing <em>people in my category</em>.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> But still: I've been pinning it for 30 minutes now. Where the hell\r\n  are the B3 leaders?\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Finally, after switchbacking downward as fast as my timid beginner\r\n  heart doth dare, I spotted a guy in blue with \"B3\" on his\r\n  calf. Awesome!  He took the right-hand option at the creek crossing,\r\n  and I took the direct line passed him and opened a gap heading into\r\n  the Roadrunner singletrack.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> But we were coming down to the wire here. I checked my time: 44\r\n  minutes and change. I knew that we had just another turn or two\r\n  before the finish. Either I was <em>winning</em> (not possible), the\r\n  leaders had already finished (for motivational purposes, I deemed\r\n  this <em>also</em> not possible), or there were still riders out here\r\n  to chase.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I realized they were probably tired. Because I was tired. This\r\n  made me smile. I was not tired any more.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Just out of the singletrack, I spotted him: green jersey, B3 on\r\n  his calf. I passed him easily, but quickly realized I'd screwed up\r\n  the follow-through: he was still with me.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> So I poured on the gas and headed for the finish, hoping he didn't\r\n  have the gas to pull around.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Alas, about 40 yards from the finish, he demonstrated that he\r\n  certainly <em>did</em> have the gas to get by me. He rolled through\r\n  so smoothly that I didn't even try to go with him. \"It's my first\r\n  race,\" I thought. \"I'm not gonna fight you for it. Couldn't if I\r\n  wanted to.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I crossed the line panting and grinning. I had no clue how I'd\r\n  placed, but I'd <em>crushed</em> my 50:00 target time: 47:05.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> And the icing on the cake came once I'd had a chance to pee,\r\n  change into clothes that were dry and smelled not at all like garbage\r\n  fermenting in the summer sun, and eat half a banana.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I'd taken <em>3rd place!</em> (<a href=\"http://replaytiming.com/2015-occ-3/\">Official results</a>.) Pretty great. I feel good about\r\n  that, and it matters not a wit that I finished 3rd\r\n  among <em>Beginners (30-39)</em>.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I can't imagine a better way for my first-ever mountain bike race\r\n  to turn out. I had a blast, beat my target time, and got to stand on\r\n  the podium.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> So yeah, I'll be at <a href=\"http://nondotadventures.com/home/races/caspers/\">the next one</a>. Can't wait!\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b><a name=\"#droppedchain\">Appendix A: Dropped Chain</a></b>\r\n\r\n<p> The correct procedure for dealing with a dropped chain:</a> If you\r\n    have some momentum, keep pedaling (slowly) and shift to the middle\r\n    ring. This will re-mount the chain. If you <em>don't</em> have\r\n    momentum, stop, lift the back tire by squeezing the front brake\r\n    and pressing forward on the bars, shift to the middle ring, and\r\n    turn the cranks with your foot. (One foot on the ground, one foot\r\n    clipped in.) This will re-mount the chain <em>way</em> faster than\r\n    getting off and spinning the cranks with your hand, like I did,\r\n    because I wasn't thinking clearly. There's a helpful instructional video <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5AsSRaF0ljM\">here</a>.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n"

Great people, a great course, and perfect trail\r\n    conditions made for lots of smiles. I think everyone had a great\r\n    time.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> And the pre-ride clarified my thinking.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I originally registered for the <em>Sport Men (30-39)</em>\r\n    category. And judging by last year's results, I <em>might</em> have\r\n    the <em>fitness</em> to finish at the back of the pack in that\r\n    category. But I'm not sure I have the <em>skills</em> to roll with\r\n    the Sport class.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> The pace on the pre-ride was comfortable, and I felt like\r\n    I <em>could</em> hammer out a second loop, but I wasn't sure it\r\n    sounded like <em>fun</em>.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> And today I did a 14-mile lunchtime loop with about 1,100 ft. of\r\n    climbing, and that <em>definitely</em> felt like enough. I didn't\r\n    have much gas left in the tank after that. So one lap at race pace\r\n    is enough, and skipping the gnarly downhill sounds great.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> So I emailed the folks\r\n    at <a href=\"http://nondotadventures.com/\">Non Dot</a> and asked\r\n    them to move me into <em>Beginner Men (30-39)</em>, and we'll see\r\n    how I do. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I knew it was the right call as soon as I sent the email.

I'll have a moment to\r\n    breathe on the way down Yucca Ridge, then it's time to kick ass up\r\n    Coachwhip. If I hit the top in good shape, I shouldn't do too\r\n    badly.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I'm also sure that this is <em>everyone's</em> plan. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> So, as ever, my goal is simply to finish generally with the\r\n    pack. My <em>stretch</em> goal is not to finish <em>last</em>.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> But I couldn't help myself. I set a goal on Strava to finish the\r\n    course in under 50:00.

I hoped that once\r\n    I got into Santiago Oaks proper the mud would subside, but a quick\r\n    chat with a couple guys coming <em>out</em> of Oaks made it clear\r\n    that <em>all</em> the trails were in terrible shape, and trying to\r\n    ride them would only damage the trails and my bike.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Today, I saught to rectify that <em>thoroughly</em> unsatisfying\r\n    ride with a lunchtime spin in Paramouont Ranch. The trails\r\n    were <em>slighly</em> damp, but totally rideable, and I had a\r\n    great time.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I was <em>aiming</em> to do the Coyote Ridge \"roller coaster\"\r\n    trail that I did on <a href=\"archive/3210\">Friday</a>, but managed\r\n    to make a couple of wrong turns that led me off-track and slowed\r\n    me down.

It's very nearly the perfect first\r\n    race. It's practically in my back yard, and it's just two weeks\r\n    away: enough time to get out and pre-ride the course so I don't\r\n    make any stupid navigation blunders, but not enough time to\r\n    actually train, or build expectations. I really can <em>just show\r\n    up and see what happens.</em>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> My one and only goal is not to DNF. My \"stretch goal\" is not to\r\n    finish DFL.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> The <a href=\"http://www.strava.com/segments/7566657?filter=overall\">course</a>\r\n    is 7.3 miles, with about 1,300ft of climbing, and I'll be doing\r\n    two laps. The race starts at 8:00 AM, and <em>ends</em> at 10:15\r\n    AM, so a 6.4mph average gets me in under the cutoff. I feel sure I\r\n    can do that.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> A look\r\n    at <a href=\"http://nondotadventures.com/home/races/results/\">last\r\n    year's results</a> tells me I need to keep my laps around 50\r\n    minutes to finish with the pack. That's an average speed of about\r\n    8.8mph, which I <em>think</em> should be doable. (Judging by\r\n    recent rides.)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> My\r\n    recent <a href=\"http://www.strava.com/activities/362983604\">ride <em>in\r\n    Santiago Oaks</em></a> was 14.8mi with 2,700ft of climbing, and my\r\n    moving time was 1:54:20, for an average speed of 7.8 mph. That'll\r\n    put me in DFL, but still ahead of DNF.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> So, I'll try to do a few solid rides between now and race day,\r\n    rest up the last few days of next week, and concentrate on simply\r\n    staying on pace and finishing under the cutoff.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n",

Depending on where you live, local road maintenance only\r\n    gets about 40% of it's funding from car-specific taxes and\r\n    fees. The rest (~60%) typically comes from the local general fund,\r\n    which is fed via sales tax. The sales tax on a bike pays for that\r\n    bike's share of road use, extra bike lanes, etc, <em>and then\r\n    some</em>. The sales tax on my two bikes would pay for <em>40\r\n    years</em> of the wear and tear I put on local roads.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> It's also fashionable to say that \"everyone should play by the\r\n    same rules.\" I agree that ideally, cyclists should obey the\r\n    law. But that's sometimes tough: current laws and roads are built\r\n    to support motor vehicle traffic. Magnetic sensors at stop lights\r\n    aren't sensitive enough to detect a bicycle, so cyclists must\r\n    wait... and wait... until a car comes along and triggers a change\r\n    in the light. Lanes are often striped such that a cyclist wishing\r\n    to go straight through an intersection must either go straight\r\n    from a right-hand-turn lane (illegal) or leave the bike lane and\r\n    occupy a traffic lane that's going straight (dangerous, unpopular,\r\n    and possibly illegal).\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Stop signs are trickier. I personally come to a full stop and put\r\n    a foot down whenever I reach a stop sign where there's motor\r\n    traffic. But I figure there's no harm in a bike rolling a stop sign on\r\n    a lonely road.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> However, you'd think that the more crowded the road, the more\r\n    important it is that cyclists obey the law. But that's\r\n    demonstrably untrue as well. A San Francisco cyclist group\r\n    recently <a href=\"http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/S-F-bike-riders-Wiggle-protest-could-stop-6413072.php\">staged\r\n    a \"civil obedience\" protest</a> where all cyclists scrupulously\r\n    obeyed all traffic laws. The result was a horrendous traffic\r\n    snarl.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Sure, there are plenty of cyclists who do stupid stuff. But the\r\n    vast majority are just trying to keep everything moving, and\r\n    moving safely. Often, they're bending the rules because the rules\r\n    are made for cars.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Several states have enacted laws allowing cyclists\r\n    to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idaho_stop\">treat stop\r\n    lights like stop signs, and stop signs like yield\r\n    signs</a>. That's a great solution, and one we should enact\r\n    nation-wide. It's good for safety, and good for traffic.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> And, in my wildest dreams, we'd start seeing protected\r\n    intersections, using the design shown in the\r\n    video, <i>everywhere</i>.\r\n</p>\r\n",

I generally only have time for five\r\n    exercises, so something gets left out. I try not to make it the\r\n    same thing every time.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> The first exercise is always a deadlift or squat. 20 reps targets\r\n    muscular endurance, and 40 reps per minute replicates pedaling at\r\n    80-90 rpm. I do deadlifts with a bar (KBs don't let me get low\r\n    enough), and squats with whatever's handy.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> (I've been doing 20 reps @ 40 rpm largely because I couldn't ride. Now that I'm starting to get back on my bike a couple times a week, that focus will likely shift, but I'm not compromising on bar speed.)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Next up is some rehab work for my shoulders and arms. I focus on\r\n    perfect form. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> For core/abdominal work, I rotate between Russian\r\n    triangles, leg raises, and 30-second planks. (I stick with one for\r\n    a given workout.) I currently do planks from the push-up position,\r\n    and focus on shoulder form. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I love 1-arm KB swings for the slight twisting motion, and for the\r\n    whole-body fatigue they enduce. Again, the focus here is on\r\n    perfect form: solid low back, explosive hinging, good shoulder\r\n    position at finish, and packing the neck.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> And I love Turkish get-ups. They work everything, and let me know\r\n    when I'm tired. They also expose flexibility/mobility issues.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> But lately I've been skipping the TGU in favor of some postural\r\n    exercises\r\n    like <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ-xUTyL0k\">YTW</a>s.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Pacing &amp; Timing</b>\r\n\r\n<p> I try not to pace myself during circuits. The goal is to execute\r\n    the exercise with good form at a quick pace, then rest between\r\n    circuits. I've come to believe that quickly building fitness means\r\n    maximizing time spent at your target intensity. When you can't\r\n    maintain that intensity, stop and rest, then go again when you've\r\n    recovered.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I don't use a clock for rests. I start the next round when my\r\n    heart rate drops below 140 bpm.

So I'm\r\n  going to talk about it here so I have something to refer to when I\r\n  get back in the saddle.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Here's how I got such great results in the last half of 2014.\r\n</p>\r\n",
    "body": "\r\n<p> <b>Weekly Totals</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<dl>\r\n  <dt><b>Hours:</b> 4:00</dt>\r\n  <dd> This seemed to be the most firm. Once I hit four hours, even\r\n    \"recovery rides\" seemed to just make me more tired.\r\n  </dd>\r\n  <dt><b>Climbing:</b> 5,500 ft.</dt>\r\n  <dd> This was more flexible. Road climbs seems to incur less fatigue\r\n    than trail. So if the week totalled out to 6,100, that's fine as\r\n    long as a fair chunk of it was on the road.\r\n  </dd>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Weekly Structure</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I don't like being locked into a training schedule that demands I\r\n  ride certain routes on certain days. So I push rides around to fit\r\n  with the rest of my life, and adjust as I go. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> The basic structure was built around a weekly microcycle, starting\r\n  with a big climb, and following up with a few rides to give me\r\n  enough cumulative load to trigger improvement. As I got stronger,\r\n  however, it shifted to accommodate two large rides each week.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> The hardest part of sticking with this program is that I had to\r\n  limit my \"big\" trail rides to 2,000 ft. of climbing. It's easy to\r\n  feel strong early in the cycle, and many of my favorite trail loops\r\n  involve about 3,000 ft. of climbing, so they're tempting. But\r\n  racking up too much fatigue early in the cycle made it difficult not\r\n  to over-extend later on. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Three (Maybe Four) Rides per Week</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li><b>Big Climb:</b> 30-minute trail climb at maximum climbing\r\n    intensity. I used Albertson most of the time. Climbing for this\r\n    ride usually worked out to about 2,000 ft.\r\n  </li>\r\n  <li><b>Moderate + Intervals:</b> I'd follow the first \"big ride\" of\r\n    the week with a more modest ride. I'd try to keep my HR around 140\r\n    BPM (seems to be my aerobic threshold), but I'd add a climbing\r\n    interval session. Usually 5 30-second all-out pushes with 90\r\n    seconds of rest (165 BPM, 90 RPM) in between. This ride should\r\n    include around 1,200 ft. of climbing.\r\n  </li>\r\n  <li><b>Rest:</b> Two days of work usually meant a day or two of rest\r\n    was in order. No recovery rides. Sometimes these were days for\r\n    Turkish get-ups, but usually it was full-on <em>rest</em>.\r\n  </li>\r\n  <li><b>Hard Effort:</b> With one rest day, I'd keep this ride to\r\n    1,500 ft of climbing. With two, I'd go for whatever\r\n    was left in my weekly climbing target.  But in either case, I'd\r\n    usually accumulate that total with several smaller climbs. The key\r\n    was to go all-out on the climbs and recover in between.\r\n  </li>\r\n  <li><b>Mop-Up:</b> If I was still <em>well</em> under my time and\r\n    climbing goals, I'd round out the week with one last ride. This\r\n    usually meant a 45-min. spin around Simi with a few quick, punchy\r\n    climbs. I'd aim to finish the ride feeling strong and smooth.\r\n  </li>\r\n  <li><b>Rest:</b> Then it's time to rest for two or three\r\n    days. Stretching, hiking, walking, etc.\r\n  </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p> Now, with all that said, my actual training log looks <em>nothing\r\n  like a regular weekly schedule</em>. I did a lot of scheduling by\r\n  feel, and by watching my <em>ten</em>-day totals as well as my\r\n  weekly totals. I pushed rides up or back on the calendar based on\r\n  when I had time to ride. And I'd skip my \"mop up\" ride to make sure\r\n  I was rested for a big climb on Sunday afternoon.  So in the end it\r\n  was a mix of targeting weekly totals, but scheduling around the rest\r\n  of my life.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Tools</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Having lights for my mountain bike was <em>fantastic</em>. They\r\n  made it possible to train entirely on <em>my</em> schedule, rather\r\n  than having to wait for available daylight to hit the trails. I'm\r\n  now a big believer that if you want to climb strong on trails, you\r\n  have to <em>train</em> on trails.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I liked the consistency using Albertson as my weekly \"big\r\n  climb\". It gave me a way of objectively assessing how I was\r\n  doing. But I also wanted some variety the rest of the time. Strava's\r\n  ride planning tool was <em>invaluable</em> for this. I'd do my\r\n  typical big climb early in the week, then plan out the rest of my\r\n  rides using Strava.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I got a cadence sensor, and I've been using it on my road\r\n  bike. This affected my mid-week \"moderate\" ride the most: I'd aim to\r\n  keep my average heart rate for the ride at 140 BPM, and my cadence\r\n  around 90 RPM. Seeing those two numbers on my GPS unit helped me\r\n  find the right level of effort for what should be a relatively easy\r\n  ride.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n"

I don't have a pinched\r\n    nerve because I slept wrong. I have a pinched nerve because I\r\n    neglected and overworked my neck and <em>then</em> slept wrong.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> It's common for trainers to advise their clients not to train the\r\n    neck. I now think this is wrong for at least two important reasons.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Sheltering a body part or movement in training reduces the\r\n    liklihood of injury <em>in training</em>, but\r\n    it <em>increases</em> the likelihood of injury <em>in real\r\n    life.</em> Effectively, I've been preventing training injuries to\r\n    the neck by <em>not training the neck</em>. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> We understand the importance of maintaining symmetry around hips,\r\n    knees, shoulders, and even hands and ankles. The same applies to\r\n    the neck. It's insane to build super-strong trapezius muscles and\r\n    totally neglect the deeper, smaller muscles that support the head\r\n    and neck.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Training strength and mobility in the neck should be approached\r\n    with caution, certainly. But it <em>should be approached</em>. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> So I'm taking an active role in charting my own path through the\r\n    process of restoring pain-free mobility in my neck, and then\r\n    continuing that work so that I can develop a stronger, more\r\n    durable neck that won't do this to me again.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I'm not aiming for something out of the NFL or WWE. But\r\n    I <em>will</em> take my model from MMA and BJJ. It's not about\r\n    size, it's about slowly, safely building strength and durability.\r\n</p>\r\n",

    "body": "<p> <b>I</b>\r\n\r\n<p> For some reason, after <a href=\"archive/3143\">Thursday's ride</a>,\r\n    I was deeply appreciative of how good it feels after a tough ride\r\n    to step into a hot shower, put on a set of flanel pajamas, and\r\n    flop on the couch. I sometimes think that cycling was invented not\r\n    as a sport unto itself, but simply to make the rest of life so\r\n    much more vivid.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p> <b>II</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I think I've been spoiled by <em>Practical Programming for\r\n    Strength Training</em>, which breaks down weight training into its\r\n    various elements, and describes how to manipulate those elements\r\n    to target the desired aptitude.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/The-Cyclists-Training-Bible-Friel-ebook/product-reviews/B00AWE96CW/ref=dp_top_cm_cr_acr_txt?ie=UTF8&showViewpoints=1\">The\r\n    Cyclist's Training Bible</a> doesn't seem to really work that\r\n    way. There isn't really a breakdown of the various physiological\r\n    aptitudes that go into riding, or how to effectively target them.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> That said, it seems like I've trial-and-errored my way into\r\n    something that resembles the training patterns that it recommends.\r\n    I still have <em>much</em> to learn, but it's good to know that\r\n    I'm essentially on the right track, as long as I\r\n    don't <a href=\"archive/3145\">overdo it</a>.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p> <b>III</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Daylight Saving Time ended this Sunday. So I'm (finally!)\r\n    investing in a set of lights, and get ready for some nighttime\r\n    trail rides.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>IV</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> And it's a good time to do another cycle of barbell work. I'm\r\n    thinking hypertrophy, but that's a big ask when I'm also trying to\r\n    lose weight. So I'm thinking stamina: lighter loads, longer\r\n    sets. But <em>that's</em> a big ask when I'm stacking up so much\r\n    riding. So... I don't know. Seems like the thing to do is start in\r\n    December, when I'll be riding less simply because of time and\r\n    daylight constraints.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>V</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I always know when I've hit the sweet spot between riding hard\r\n    enough to grow and riding so hard that I overtax my body. My\r\n    motivation skyrockets and I start window shopping for new bikes.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I already have my next two bikes picked out:\r\n    a <a href=\"http://salsacycles.com/bikes/warbird\">Salsa Warbird</a>\r\n    to ride as a road/fire rd/easy trail bike, and\r\n    a <a href=\"http://salsacycles.com/bikes/beargrease\">Salsa\r\n        Beargrease</a> fatbike, because fatbike.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>VI</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Some number crunching on Strava suggests that I actually had a\r\n    really strong ride on Thursday. I was <em>climbing</em> faster\r\n    than PR pace for the entire climb.  So what happened?  I dropped\r\n    <em>20 seconds</em> on the first flat section, and another 15 on\r\n    the short reprieve at around 1&frac34; miles. So now I know: make\r\n    the most of those flats &amp; downhills.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> And that's as much as I'm going to think about strategy. I'm\r\n    aiming to be <em>minutes</em> faster, and the cleverest strategy\r\n    in the world isn't going to get that done.  I need to get fitter:\r\n    lose weight, get stronger.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

That left me\r\n    with two rough \"halves.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\">\r\n    <tr>\r\n        <td></td>\r\n        <th>1st Half</th>\r\n        <th>2nd Half</th>\r\n    </tr>\r\n    <tr>\r\n        <th>Avg.

Which tells me... not a lot, actually. Is the drop due to\r\n    a lower heart rate? Is it because this is my third ride in three\r\n    days and I'm fatigued? I need more context.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> So I looked at yesterday's ride.  Since it was easy right from the\r\n    start, and I kept a steady pace, I was able to simply grab the\r\n    first and second halves, without munging the data at all.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\">\r\n    <tr>\r\n        <td></td>\r\n        <th>1st Half</th>\r\n        <th>2nd Half</th>\r\n    </tr>\r\n    <tr>\r\n        <th>Avg.

That's half\r\n    a percent. About as close to perfect as anyone cares to get. (Also\r\n    note that my average heart rate for both halves was right around\r\n    140 bpm.)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> So what?\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I <em>think</em> it means that my aerobic endurance over 60\r\n    minutes is solid (provided I'm fresh).  But I know that\r\n    I <em>feel</em> like I fade after an hour or so.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I did a ride last week that was long for me: 30 miles or so, and\r\n    it took about 2 hours.  So I dug into the data for that.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> As expected, I faded <em>hard</em> in the second hour, with my\r\n    W/bpm ratio falling more than 17%. I wanted more detail, so I\r\n    broke out this ride into half-hour chunks.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\">\r\n    <tr>\r\n        <td></td>\r\n        <th>1st 30 min</th>\r\n        <th>2nd 30 min</th>\r\n        <th>3rd 30 min</th>\r\n        <th>4th 30 min</th>\r\n    </tr>\r\n    <tr>\r\n        <th>Avg.

But I just plummet after that, which doesn't match how\r\n    I <em>felt</em> at all.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> It could be that I'm most efficent at around 140 bpm, so when my\r\n    HR dropped to around 120, my power output kind of crashed. Or it\r\n    could be that the short, sharp climb I did just before heading\r\n    home really did cook me, but I never realized it because I was\r\n    cruising downhill toward home and not really trying very hard.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> And it would make sense if my W/bpm ration surged in the second 30\r\n    minute period, as my HR increased to around 150 bpm and (maybe) I\r\n    started dipping into my anaerobic energy supplies.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> What <em>is</em> totally clear is that I need to learn more, and I\r\n    need to do a two-hour ride at a steady 140 bpm and see what turns\r\n    up.\r\n</p>\r\n"

    "body": "<p> First, a busy day led to bad food choices.  I ate fast food\r\n  (burgers & fries) for lunch <em>and</em> dinner (<em>with</em> a\r\n  chocolate shake), and then piled on a sugary drink and more desert\r\n  later on.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I've been craving vegetables ever since. Suddenly, I <em>love</em>\r\n  giant salads. Kale, spinach, Swiss chard, whatever.  Garbanzo beans,\r\n  beats, sprouts, quinoa, carrots, beats, cucumbers, pile it on.\r\n  Throw some grilled chicken on top, and I'm happy.  I've had\r\n  something along those lines for lunch pretty much every day since.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Second, I'm reading\r\n  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/The-Cyclists-Training-Bible-Friel-ebook/dp/B00AWE96CW/ref=cm_cr_pr_product_top\">The\r\n    Cyclist's Training Bible</a>, and realizing just how much I have\r\n  to learn if I really want to get fast, and how important it is to\r\n  have a solid aerobic base.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Third, a heat wave descended, with temperatures hitting 90&deg;\r\n  or more by mid-morning, and staying over 100&deg; until after\r\n  dark. I'm unwilling to brave that kind of heat, so I was stuck\r\n  inside through the weekend.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Put that all together, and it gave me a moment to rethink.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I need to re-focus on dropping fat. That's job #1 on the list, and\r\n  whenever I try to split my focus, I stop losing weight.  So I have\r\n  one and only one focus: eat well, and burn calories.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> That makes this a good time to return to aerobic base building:\r\n  consistency, building volume, riding whatever I want, and building\r\n  strength and general fitness.  \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> So last week, I just set out to simply build time, and just ride\r\n  whatever I wanted. The result was really interesting.  First, I'm\r\n  having fun just heading out on rides without really thinking too\r\n  hard about where I want to go. Sometimes there's a plan, but mostly\r\n  it's \"go wherever seems interesting.\" Second, it's clear how long\r\n  it's been since I did a ride longer than a lunch break.  Short,\r\n  sharp rides are <em>not</em> a substitute for LSD training.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I have some time over the next few weeks, so I'm just going to\r\n  keep doing what I'm doing: daily cardio workouts, eating well, and\r\n  generally making sure I'm staying on my food plan. I <em>hope</em>\r\n  I'll head into the holiday season with a solid aerobic base and\r\n  weighing under 190 lbs.\r\n</p>\r\n"

I hate it when I find myself thinking, \"I used\r\n  to have a super-simple solution to this, but I can't remember...\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> The nutshell: <b>Fill two bottls with ice water. Add drink mix to\r\n  one of them.  For long rides, take extra mix.</b>\r\n</p>\r\n",
    "body": "\r\n<p> A few weeks ago, I was headed for\r\n  an <a href=\"archive/3089\">after-work ride</a>, and realized I'd\r\n  forgotten to bring water bottles.  I stopped in at the bike shop for\r\n  bottles, and on a whim I grabbed two single-serving packets of\r\n  Skratch mix.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I filled both bottles with water, but I only put Skratch in the\r\n  first. It turned out to be a great system. It was a warm day, and\r\n  before long I found myself alternating pulls between the two\r\n  bottles.  The Skratch kept me fueled, and the plain ice water kept\r\n  me cool and hydrated.  At the top of that long climb, I\r\n  felt <em>great</em>.  Ready to go again, in fact.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> So here's what I take with me on most rides these days:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li> 1 bottle drink mix (1 scoop powder, water, lots of ice)</li>\r\n  <li> 1 bottle ice water (all the ice it can hold, then water)</li>\r\n  <li> (for longer rides) 2 oz. plastic Nalgine bottle with more drink\r\n  mix powder</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p> Having a bottle of mix and a bottle of plain water lets me grab\r\n  what I want. And the little 2 oz. bottle is awesome.  (I had a\r\n  couple <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Nalgene-Bottle-Kit-Medium/dp/B000LGG82M/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1408116828&sr=8-3&keywords=nalgene+travel+kit\">lying\r\n  around</a>.)  Instead of buying expensive single-serving packets, I\r\n  buy in bulk and use my own reusable container. Just great.\r\n</p>\r\n"

I generally take\r\n    four <a href=\"http://www.naturemade.com/fish-oil-and-omegas/fish-oil-and-omega-3/fish-oil-one-per-day\">Nature\r\n    Made Fish Oil 1200</a> gelcaps each night with dinner.  (I used to\r\n    worry that this is too much, but have read about too many\r\n    athletes, and even a neuroscientist and micronutrient researcher,\r\n    who take substantially more than that.)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> About three weeks ago, I switched\r\n    to <a href=\"http://www.naturemade.com/fish-oil-and-omegas/triple-omega\">Triple\r\n    Omega</a> supplement. I thought getting the Omegas from a variety\r\n    of sources might be good, and I'd recently read about how awesome\r\n    flax seed oil is.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Unfortunately, it didn't seem to work nearly as well as the fish\r\n    oil.

When I did it back in June, I felt great, but\r\n    found that my strength fell sharply after about 45 minutes in the\r\n    saddle.  Last week, I was working out far less, but feeling more\r\n    and more tired and achy.  There were two obvious possibilities:\r\n    either I was more deeply fatigued than I thought, or switching from fish oil to the Triple Omega supplement wasn't working out.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I tested the theory. I switched back to my old fish oil supplement\r\n    this week, and I'm feeling <em>much</em> better.  I'm cranking out\r\n    workouts like I used to, I slept great after yesterday's circuit\r\n    training, and today I couldn't wait to finish work and go climb\r\n    Black Canyon, one of the steepest, meanest road climbs around.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> It's great to feel like myself again. But there's another lesson\r\n    to be learned here: I need to do some homework and understand the\r\n    difference between the fish oil and Triple Omega supplements.\r\n</p>\r\n"

When I\r\n    crashed and broke that one, I just got another.  And when the\r\n    heart rate monitor on that one died, I pulled a Dr. Frankenstein\r\n    and combined the parts from two broken units into one working one.\r\n    But the heart rate monitor on that one finally died as well, and\r\n    it was time to upgrade.\r\n</p>\r\n",
    "body": "<p> My philosophy on buying gear: if it's something that's going to\r\n    wear out, like tires, then I carefully consider the cost/quality\r\n    trade-off.  But if it's a key item that I'm going to keep for a\r\n    long time, I get the best I can afford.  \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I started out hoping that the best option would be to mount my old\r\n    iPhone 4 would work as a cycling computer.  A few apps seemed\r\n    promising, and I even ordered\r\n    a <a href=\"http://www.quadlockcase.com/\">Quad Lock mounting\r\n    system</a> to give the whole arrangement a whirl.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> The Quad Lock system was great.  Easy to use,\r\n    and <em>super</em>-secure.  But the \"old iPhone\" solution has a\r\n    few problems that make it a no-go for me.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> First, the old iPhone doesn't currently have cell service.  The\r\n    battery life suffered becuase the phone was constantly looking for\r\n    a cell connection. Switching to \"Airplane Mode\" saved the battery,\r\n    but made the GPS unreliable because the phone could no longer use\r\n    cell tower information to help determine location.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I <em>could</em> use my currently activated mobile phone (an\r\n    iPhone 5s) as my cycling computer.  But I honestly just don't like\r\n    the idea of using my lifeline as my cycling computer.  If I get\r\n    stranded somewhere and can't call anyone for a ride because I ran\r\n    the battery down, I'm going to feel <em>really</em> dumb.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I also looked at\r\n    a <a href=\"http://www.wahoofitness.com/devices/rflkt.html\">Wahoo\r\n    Fitness RFLKT</a>, which is a little weatherproof screen that\r\n    displays information from your cellphone.  Really cool option, but\r\n    I worried about compatibility issues. I just don't trust the\r\n    RFLKT, my iPhone, an iPhone app, <em>and</em> my heart rate\r\n    monitor all to play nicely together for the next 5 years.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> So.  A dedicated unit it is.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> The Garmin Edge 500 seems to be the standard among the dedicated\r\n    cyclists I meet. And I always loved my Forerunner, so I was fine\r\n    sticking with Garmin. And a look around the web at stuff from\r\n    Cateye just failed to impress.  They really seem to look and work\r\n    like old digital watches.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> And then Elden \"Fat Cyclist\" Nelson blogged\r\n    about <a href=\"http://www.fatcyclist.com/2014/07/24/the-joys-of-quantification-part-1-which-garmin-compatible-mount-should-you-buy/\">Garmin-compatible\r\n    mounts</a> and\r\n    the <a href=\"http://www.fatcyclist.com/2014/07/28/the-joys-of-quantification-part-2-garmin-edge-510-long-term-usage-thoughts/\">Edge\r\n    510</a>, and then pointed out how much\r\n    he <a href=\"http://www.fatcyclist.com/2010/09/22/stuff-fatty-loves-the-garmin-edge-500/\">loved\r\n    his old Edge 500</a>.  Sold.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I got\r\n    the <a href=\"https://buy.garmin.com/en-US/US/into-sports/cycling/edge-500/prod36728.html\">Edge\r\n    500</a> with the premium heart rate strap, and\r\n    a <a href=\"http://www.barflybike.com/bar-fly-mtb/\">Barfly 3.0</a>\r\n    mount for my mountain bike.  I'm going to try the mount included\r\n    with the Edge 500 on my road bike for a bit, but I've never been\r\n    100% on using rubber bands to permanently mount something to my\r\n    bike.  I might go with zip ties, but honestly I think the writing\r\n    is on the wall, and I'll be ordering either\r\n    a <a href=\"https://buy.garmin.com/en-US/US/shop-by-accessories/mounts/out-front-bike-mount/prod114881.html\">Garmin\r\n    out-front mount</a> or\r\n    a <a href=\"http://www.acecosportgroup.com/k-edge-computer-mounts/new-garmin-edge-and-forerunner-gps-computer-mount/k-edge-computer-mount-for-garmin-edge-and-forerunner-gps-computers.html\">K-Edge\r\n    mount</a>.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I have yet to take my new GPS out for a ride.  But I already like\r\n    it better than my old Forerunner.  <em>All</em> the screens are\r\n    configurable, and I was able to figure out how to configure\r\n    them <em>without</em> needing the manual.  And with the Barfly\r\n    3.0, mounting to the handlebars feels really secure.  Total\r\n    confidence that it's not going <em>anywhere</em>, yet I have no\r\n    trouble putting it on, taking it off.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I have two nitpicks.  First, The matte black finish on the bottom\r\n    of the unit with the white \"GARMIN\" inlay looks awesome.  The\r\n    silver carbon-esque pattern on the face bezel looks like a cheap\r\n    digital watch.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Second, I <em>loved</em> that the start/stop button on my\r\n    Forerunner was bigger than the other buttons and <em>red</em>.  I\r\n    understand that Garmin probably wanted a cleaner look, but being\r\n    able to easily find (visually <em>and</em> by touch) was\r\n    a <em>huge</em> usability improvement.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> But overall, this unit is great.  Taking it for a shake-out ride\r\n    today to get used to it before trying anything real.\r\n</p>\r\n"

    "intro": "<p> With the tires on my mountain bike <a href=\"archive/3097\">not\r\n    holding air</a>, I had a choice: take it back to the shop, or take\r\n    up arms against a sea of troubles.  (Or, rather, a dwindling\r\n    puddle of Stan's Sealant.)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> The <em>usual</em> way of adding more sealant is to pull a bit of\r\n    the tire bead off the rim, pour in some sealant, and then use an\r\n    air compressor to re-mount the tire.  But I don't have an air\r\n    compressor.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Luckily, there's an alternative for tires that are already\r\n    mounted: remove the valve core, and inject the sealant straight\r\n    into the tire through the valve body.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Seemed simple enough.  Worth a shot.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> So I stopped by the shop today, and bought what I need to tackle\r\n  the problem myself.\r\n</p>\r\n",
    "body": "<p> I put 1oz in the front tire (which was doing okay on rides, but\r\n  fading overnight), and a little more than 2oz into the rear (which\r\n  was a total mess).  And it seems to have worked.  I took the bike\r\n  out for a shake-out ride, and both tires did fine.  But the real\r\n  test will be how much pressure is left in those tires tomorrow\r\n  morning.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> It's worth noting that I got what I needed at the same shop that's\r\n  been doing all the maintainance on my tubeless\r\n  setup: <a href=\"http://www.winswheels.com/\">Win's Wheels</a> in\r\n  Westlake Village.  A mechanic there pointed me to the syringe and\r\n  sealant, and did not <em>once</em> mention anything about letting\r\n  them do the work.  That's typical of everyone at the shop: hero\r\n  repair and maintenance work and first-rate customer service.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> So many shops might be reluctant to sell me what I need to take on\r\n  work I used to pay them to do.  Win's must see it (correctly) as\r\n  win/win: I get my supplies from them, so I'm a happy customer, and\r\n  they get to focus on more lucrative work than just putting sealant\r\n  in my tires.  As a result, they're the first place I think of when I\r\n  need anything.  I wish more businesses had such clear vision.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> In any event, I'll have to check on my tires in the morning and\r\n  see how they're doing.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> To be continued...\r\n</p>\r\n"

    "intro": "<p> I'm game for a big ride, but today I simply didn't have the time\r\n  or energy to spare for a big loop.  Corral Cyn is essentially a\r\n  giant climb to nowhere.  The only place to go from the top is back\r\n  down, which helps explain why Strava shows that just over 300 people\r\n  have climbed it.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> An iffy night's sleep and an early start this morning\r\n  took <em>some</em> of the wind out of my sails, and my sleepy brain\r\n  kept heckling me, telling me this was a 9-mile climb (it's really\r\n  just 6&frac12;), and that it would take me 2 hours to reach the top.\r\n  I knew that couldn't be right, so I finally just stopped listening\r\n  and concentrated on climbing strong, knowing that a 2,000 ft. climb\r\n  should take about an hour.  Still, I'd like to head back at some\r\n  point and have another go when I'm fresh.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I drove home up Latigo Cyn, and the road was full of people on\r\n  bikes grinding up the hill.  Pretty amazing.  I must have passed 20\r\n  cyclists.  Sunday morning seems to be party time on Latigo.\r\n</p>\r\n",

    "intro": "<p> I knew I wouldn't have time for a \"real\" ride on Thursday, so I\r\n    decided to do two \"half\" rides on Wednesday and Thursday, each\r\n    with a moderate Cat 3 climb, rather than a big Cat 2 or Cat\r\n    1. Good plan, but the execution left room for improvement.\r\n</p>\r\n",
    "body": "<p> First, I hugely underestimated\r\n    the <a href=\"http://app.strava.com/segments/810244\">climb to China\r\n    Flat </a>.  For whatever reason, I figured it would be about like\r\n    climbing the upper half of Chumash, which is demanding, but not\r\n    horrible.  But this climb is genuinely <em>hard</em>.  Sections\r\n    are super-steep, and <em>very</em> loose. I <em>might</em> be able\r\n    to ride it clean on a good day.  But just two days\r\n    after <a href=\"archive/3096\">climbing Piuma and Schueren</a>, I\r\n    still wasn't 100%.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Second, the weather was fantastic until about 20 minutes into the\r\n    ride, when Mother Nature realized it was mid-July in Southern\r\n    California after all.  The sun burned off the cloud cover and just\r\n    kept right on cooking.  Temps were reasonable, but that\r\n    sun... rough.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> And on the spin back down Las Virgenes Cyn, my rear tire started\r\n    feeling kind of splashy, and I started hearing that\r\n    tell-tale <em>brrrrrup!</em> sound on the corners.  It was slowly\r\n    going flat.  The tires I have are <em>not</em> tubeless-ready, and\r\n    have thin sidewalls, and the guys at the shop did hero work just\r\n    getting them mounted <em>at all</em>, so it's no surprise they're\r\n    not 100% bomber.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I pumped them back up last night, and did my best to make sure\r\n    that the sealant found its way to the spots that needed it.  And this\r\n    morning, it looks like they're holding.  One more lesson learned: add\r\n    Stan's, then ride <em>immediately.</em>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Today's ride went like clockwork. Cool breezes kept teperatures in\r\n    the mid 70's, and I warmed up for a couple of minutes, took three\r\n    minutes off my <a href=\"http://app.strava.com/segments/661176\">Top\r\n    of the World climb</a> PR, then spun back to the car.  All in\r\n    about 35 minutes.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> And there was a road improvement crew up on Yerba Buena Rd.\r\n    Here's hoping the blacktop along there will get some much-needed\r\n    love soon!\r\n</p>\r\n"

    "intro": "<p> So.  About a month ago I <a href=\"archive/3079\">bent a tooth</a>\r\n  on my middle chainring.  I replaced the ring, but shifting was a bit\r\n  off, and on a ride last week I had to deal with the most stubbornly\r\n  jammed chain I've ever seen.  Time for a new chain.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Replacing the chain, I realized just how worn my old chain\r\n  really was.  It had \"stretched\" by more than an inch.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Drivetrain components are among the most reasonably priced\r\n  components of my bike.  The total cost of three chainrings, a\r\n  cassette, and a chain was less than the cost of my new tires.  (The\r\n  sprocket &amp; lockring tools brought the total up, but were still\r\n  less than the cost of having the work done at the shop.)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> So I now have a completely new drivetrain.  I've replaced my\r\n  12-36T cassette with an 11-34T.

    "intro": "<p> I crossed paths with another rider last week.  He was a few years\r\n    younger than me, and super-fit.  We had similar builds, similar\r\n    bikes, and we were riding the same roads.  In a weird\r\n    movie-montage moment, I imagined I saw my doppleganger, the one\r\n    who'd skipped the cookies and take-out lunches.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> It made me realize how fed up I am with being stalled half-way\r\n    through the process of reaching my <a href=\"archive/3019\">2014\r\n    body composition goal.</a>  And it made me own up to the fact that\r\n    I'm fully capable of educating myself, carrying through,\r\n    and <em>becoming</em> that cyclist.  I just haven't made the\r\n    effort.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> And it made me realize, for the 700-th time, that Janell\r\n    does <em>all</em> the cooking in the house.  I can't remember the\r\n    last time I did more than throw pre-packaged cookie dough in the\r\n    oven.  That's gotta change, and if it means tricking myself into\r\n    thinking that cooking is really about cycling, then so be it.  I'm\r\n    not above stupid psychological ploys to get myself moving in the\r\n    right direction.\r\n</p>\r\n",
    "body": "<p> I'm focusing on three recipe books:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li><a href=\"http://www.skratchlabs.com/collections/food/products/the-feed-zone-cookbook\">The Feed Zone Cookbook</a></li>\r\n    <li><a href=\"http://www.skratchlabs.com/products/feed-zone-portables\">Feed Zone Portables</a></li>\r\n    <li><a href=\"http://www.runnersworldcookbook.com/runnersworldcookbook/ps/index?keycode=237346\">Runner's World Cookbook</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p> I bought <em>The Feed Zone Cookbook</em> a while back, and I\r\n    really like the Asian influence and the simplicity of the recipes.\r\n    It hits the right combination of meals I want to eat <em>and</em>\r\n    feel like I can prepare.  So <em>Feed Zone Portables</em> seemed\r\n    like a no-brainer for packable workday meals.  And I'm kind of\r\n    taking a chance on the <em>Runner's World Cookbook</em>.  For now,\r\n    I'm assuming that recipes for athletes won't lead me <em>too</em>\r\n    far astray from good nutrition.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> On Friday and Saturday, I looked through the Feed Zone books and\r\n    picked out a few things I wanted to try, and copied &amp; pasted\r\n    them into <a href=\"http://paprikaapp.com/\">Paprika</a>,\r\n    a <em>fantastic</em> app for managing recipes.  A few taps later,\r\n    Paprika had compiled a shopping list of all the stuff I'd need.\r\n    (Seriously.  Paprika is awesome.  I like it so much I paid for the\r\n    iPhone, iPad, <em>and</em> OS X versions.)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> On Sunday afternoon my wife and I did our usual weekend grocery\r\n    shopping trip, and then it was time to get to work.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I made a breakfast porrige of almond milk, rice, and banana that\r\n    I've done a couple of times before.  In the spirit of\r\n    breakfast-themed experimentation, I swapped the brown sugar for\r\n    maple syrup.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I also tried a basic \"baked scrambled egg\".  Basically, drop\r\n    beaten eggs into a muffin pan and cook them in the oven instead of\r\n    the stove top.  I added a bit of rice in the bottom, hoping that\r\n    it would form a bit of a crust.  It didn't.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> And finally, I made the zucchini and spinach \"fritata\", which is\r\n    really more of a bread pudding.  This one took more prep time (~10\r\n    minutes of chopping zucchini and spinach), but still pretty\r\n    painless.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Today for lunch, I have:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>portion of porrige (280cal, 12g protein, 45g carbs, 3g fat)</li>\r\n    <li>two baked eggs with rice (200cal, 14g protein, 6g carbs, 12g fat)</li>\r\n    <li>two zucchini fritatas (200cal, 12g protein, 6g carbs, 6g fat)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p> Total: 680cal, 38g protein, 57g carbs, 21g fat.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> That's a great lunch, from my own kitchen, nicely balanced for my\r\n    post-ride nutritional needs.  And there are two more just like it\r\n    in my fridge.  Awesome.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Yeah, all those eggs come with more fat than I'd like.  But this\r\n    meal is still a <em>huge</em> improvement over a take-out burrito\r\n    or sandwich.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> They say that if you do something for a month, it becomes a habit,\r\n    and it becomes more comfortable to keep doing it than to deviate.\r\n    So this is day 1.  I'll check in on July 16 and see where I'm at.\r\n</p>\r\n"

    "intro": "<p> The last couple of weeks were big for me.  10 days, 7 rides, 86\r\n    miles, 8800 ft. of climbing.  So I'm a bit tired.  Today's lunch\r\n    ride was typical of what happens when I've accumulated a few big\r\n    rides and need to back off: PR'ed the first half of Cornell Rd.,\r\n    then faded fast.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> So this may be a week of recovery.  The plan is to go easy for a\r\n    few days, doing short, sharp workouts &amp; rides, and see how I\r\n    feel next week.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Which is a bummer.  A strong local\r\n    rider <a href=\"http://app.strava.com/activities/150245849\">threw\r\n    down the gauntlet</a> on the Simi bike path last week.  I haven't\r\n    riden the bike path in a while, and it's fun to have a reason to\r\n    get excited about it again.  Can't wait to have a go.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> After being on a few hikes lately, I was reminded that when a\r\n    rider is coming up quick behind you, even the friendliest, \"On\r\n    your left!\" can come off like, \"Outta my way!\"  My wife and I\r\n    agreed that a bike bell is <em>far</em> nicer.  So I put\r\n    an <a href=\"https://www.mirrycle.com/original_bell.php\">Incredibell</a>\r\n    on my mountain bike, and it's great.  Quiet during even rocky\r\n    riding, but loud and clear when I hit the lever. Just great.\r\n    Gonna get one for my road bike too.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n",

I immediately realized I was on the wrong ring.\r\n    So, like the optimist I am, I accelerated for two strokes, then\r\n    shifted down.  Unfortunately, the steepness killed all my\r\n    momentum, and I ended up having to push <em>hard</em> on the\r\n    pedals mid-shift.  I remember thinking, \"<em>Not good for the\r\n    chain but I'll be okay...</em>\" and then <em>BANG!</em>  The shift\r\n    finished, forward movement resumed, and I finished out the climb.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> It was a few minutes later that I discovered the extent of my\r\n    stupid.\r\n</p>\r\n",

And the chain dropped\r\n    again. And I doubled over the bars.  Again.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Turns out I (badly) bent a tooth on my middle ring.  My little and\r\n    big rings are fine, but that middle... not so much.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> So, I've got a stack of maintenance items to take care of this\r\n    weekend:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>replace middle chainring.</li>\r\n    <li>(possibly) replace chain</li>\r\n    <li>clean &amp; lube drive train</li>\r\n    <li>adjust rear derailluer</li>    \r\n    <li>replace front &amp; rear brake pads</li>\r\n    <li>bleed front &amp; rear brakes</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p> Might be tricky to find the time.

I can't force it.\r\n  Can't use it to \"burn off stress.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> The <a href=\"archive/3067\">last time I climbed this</a>, I\r\n  felt <em>super</em>-strong.  I felt like I was holding something\r\n  back.  Now I know that I <em>was</em> holding something back.  Last\r\n  night I stopped to try \"The Tricky Section\" a few times, and veered\r\n  off the line a few times and had to catch my breath and re-mount,\r\n  and <em>still</em> only a minute behind my PR.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> So now I know.  Bulldog and Backbone are for stress relief.\r\n  There's zero technique involved.  You can just head up the climb and\r\n  turn off your brain and just get busy crushing imaginary enemies.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> But Dead Cow... it's actually more like playing a difficult piece\r\n  of music than riding a bike.  There are ebbs and flows to the\r\n  energy, and each section sets you up for the next.  Rush it, forget\r\n  to breathe, lose your concentration or composure, and you're done.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Anyway, I felt tired yesterday.  It's good to discover that I had\r\n  a strong ride, and was only \"tired\" relative to how stressed out I\r\n  was after a frustrating day at work.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I was going to take tonight off, but after checking out Mike\r\n  Curiak's video (above), I'm stoked to get in a little sunset spin.\r\n</p>\r\n",

I shouldn't have.  Traction is\r\n    <em>excellent</em>.  I had the pressure at 23f/25r, and had zero\r\n    slippage on the climb up Long Canyon, or the horse trail up the\r\n    back side of Coyote Ridge.  The handling is solid, and the ride is\r\n    super-smooth.  I was cruising between 18 and 20 mph on concrete.\r\n    My old tires typically had me around 15-17 mph.  Very happy.\r\n</p>\r\n"

The statue is a slightly bothersome relec of\r\n  earlier days.  It was carved out of concrete back in 1930 by a guy\r\n  claiming to be a Polish Count as a tribute to the Chumash people who\r\n  are the original inhabitants of Agoura.  Unfortunately, the good\r\n  Count didn't really do his homework, and the statue is\r\n  actually <a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/2004/may/13/local/me-surround13\">based\r\n  on a Seminole</a>.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> It's easy to see the statue as a relic of old, less culturally\r\n  sensitive times.  But to me, it's always been a reminder of local\r\n  history, both good and ill.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I used to see the statue all the time, and thought it had been\r\n  removed.

And you\r\n  can't make a new, encrypted backup with a new password.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Apple has an entirely\r\n  unhelpful <a href=\"http://support.apple.com/kb/TS5162\">troubleshooting\r\n  page</a> that amounts to, \"Try some other passwords you might have\r\n  used.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> With iTunes effectively useless, Plan B was to back up the old 4s\r\n  to iCloud, then restore from iCloud to the new 5s.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Unfortunately, iCloud does <em>not</em> keep any of the data in\r\n  your apps, or store any of your login information.  If you want to\r\n  keep any data from your apps, you need some other way of getting\r\n  that data off your phone.  With iCloud, you're S.O.L.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> To sum up: <b>Once you've made an encrypted backup and forgotten\r\n    your password, <em>there is no way to move all your data en masse to a\r\n      new phone</em>.</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> So I've spent some time this morning getting ahead of the game so\r\n  this never happens again:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li>Used iTunes to make a new, encrypted backup of my iPhone.</li>\r\n  <li>Stored the password\r\n    in <a href=\"https://agilebits.com/onepassword\">1Password</a> so I\r\n    can't lose it.  1Password data is automatically synced to all my\r\n    devices, and backed up\r\n    to <a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/\">Dropbox</a>.\r\n  </li>\r\n  <li>Made a new, <em>un-</em>encrypted backup of my iPhone, in case\r\n    catastrophe strikes and 1Password fails me.\r\n  </li>\r\n  <li>Confirmed that my iPhone automatically backs itself up to iCloud\r\n    whenever I plug it has power and wifi.\r\n  </li>  \r\n  <li>Repeated the process for my iPad.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p> The first, best way to restore my phone, or migrate to a new\r\n  phone, is to restore from the encrypted backup in iTunes.  That\r\n  has <em>everything</em>.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Second place is a toss-up between the unencrypted backup in iTunes\r\n  and the iCloud backup.  The iCloud backup will more up-to-date, but\r\n  takes an hour or two to download.  The unencrypted iTunes backup\r\n  will restore faster, but will most likely be kind of old.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> In short, the single best way to make sure <em>all</em> your\r\n  iPhone's data is backed up is to make an encrypted backup in iTunes.\r\n  But once you do that, <em>do not lose that password</em>.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> And, just because the universe tends toward maximum irony, I'm\r\n  going through my <em>entire</em> backup process this morning.

It simply develops aptitudes that are more\r\n  important on roads than on trails.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> So Thursday I got back to the business of developing \"punchy\"\r\n  power.  The Pantachaeta Trail and the Reservoir Trail near the\r\n  tennis club in Westlake are perfect for this.  I climbed up a\r\n  horrible, gravelly side trail, then up the horrible, gravelly, rocky\r\n  trail to the reservoir, then rode the Pantachaeta trail out to\r\n  Triunfo and back, punching hard through all the technical sections\r\n  and climbs.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> And Thursday night I tried a version of the Evil 8 barbell complex\r\n  that I've been wanting to try for a while.  The notion is simple: do\r\n  it <em>by the book</em>.  The Evil 8 strictly by the book (6 sets,\r\n  90-second rests, 12-min. total time) leaves you just 4&frac12;\r\n  minutes to do 168 total reps.  That works out to about 40 reps per\r\n  minute.  So I set my metronome to 40 bpm, and got to work.  The\r\n  result was a stellar workout that I'll definitely keep in my\r\n  toolbox.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> In the long term, though, I need to be done with the Evil 8.  It's\r\n  time to mix it up: unilateral movement, plyometrics, lateral\r\n  movement, etc.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Hell, I might even get out my inline skates.  <em>That's</em> a\r\n  hell of a workout: alternating explosive movement with static\r\n  holds <em>and</em> lateral movement, with a healthy dose of\r\n  stability work.  Great stuff.  (And the success\r\n  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Team-7-Eleven-American-Cyclists-World--ebook/dp/B006TGGNKU/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1395518719&sr=8-1&keywords=7-11+cycling+team\">history\r\n  of Team 7-Eleven</a> supports the notion that skating makes for\r\n  solid cycling legs.)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> What I do know is that after the last three days (Johnson,\r\n  Pantachaeta, Evil 8, and a lunchtime road ride), I need a day off in\r\n  a way that I haven't in weeks.  It's clear that the stripped-down\r\n  TCTP I was doing was <em>too</em> stripped-down.  Not enough volume,\r\n  and not enough pure power work.  But I learned a great deal, and I\r\n  know how to fix what's missing.\r\n</p>\r\n"

My <a href=\"archive/3038\">ride out\r\n  through Camarillo</a> a couple weeks and my \"easy\" trail ride last\r\n  weekend showed me just how hard my current program really is.  It's\r\n  only low volume <em>relative to dedicated amature athletes</em>, who\r\n  train 10+ hours a week.  And it's high intensity <em>all the\r\n  time</em>.  There are no easy days, just rest days.  So I need to\r\n  let those rest days be <em>rest</em> days.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Second, I realized that <a href=\"archive/3041\">raising the load\r\n  from 75# to 95#</a> was too much.  It left me too drained to produce\r\n  quality work later in the week.  So I dropped the load to 85#.

    "body": "<p> Eszter Horanyi has a great set of notes\r\n  on <a href=\"http://salsacycles.com/culture/riding_the_rocks_from_someone_still_learning#When:09:00:32Z\">technical\r\n  climbing technique</a>.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <a href=\"http://lwcoaching.com/improve-technical-mtb-ride-skills/\">Coach\r\n    Lynda Wallenfels</a> posts a great example of how to put together\r\n    an effective skills session.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I was struck by how closely this matches\r\n  <a href=\"archive/920\">sight reading work</a>\r\n  and <a href=\"archive/1348\">rock climbing</a>.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Coach Lynda's focus on mental cues (\"weight my feet\", \"eyes\r\n  forward\") to trigger whole patterns of movement is awesome.  And it\r\n  mirrors what both Dan John and Mark Rippetoe have mentioned in\r\n  coaching weightlifters.  Trying to micro-manage every muscle leads\r\n  to an uncoordinated tangle of individual movements.  But a\r\n  well-chosen mental cue can help the whole body move as one.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I've been\r\n  reading <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/The-Inner-Game-Tennis-Performance-ebook/dp/B003T0G9E4/ref=tmm_kin_title_popover?ie=UTF8&qid=1391208515&sr=8-1\">The\r\n  Inner Game of Tennis</a>, the classic book on the mental side of\r\n  sports and skills performance.  The author, W. Timothy Gallwey,\r\n  talks about learning through demonstration and awareness, rather\r\n  than by nit-picking mistakes, trying to \"improve.\"  That neatly\r\n  mirrors Coach Lynda's approach, which focuses on demonstration\r\n  followed by focused practice.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> And, of course, this all resonates with me because it's how I've\r\n  learned naturally all my life.  I often want to be left alone to\r\n  simply experiment and see what happens, rather than focus on getting\r\n  \"better\".  I learned to play the classic video game <em>Street\r\n  Fighter II</em> not by focusing on winning, but by trying crazy\r\n  ideas just to see what would happen.  \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> If you let go of winning and losing, there's no risk in trying\r\n  something new, and everything to gain.\r\n</p>\r\n"

The\r\n  notion seems to be that it provides a bird's eye view of your ride\r\n  history, but it shows you just one cross-section of that data at a\r\n  time.  You can see aggregated volume <em>or</em>\r\n  climbing <em>or</em> time, but only one.  \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> You can't fully characterize a training week (or a single ride)\r\n  based on <em>just</em> the distance, or <em>just</em> the climbing\r\n  total or <em>just</em> the duration.  No matter how I try to look at\r\n  this page, I always feel like some part of the picture is missing.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I just can't get my head around why, on a page with so much\r\n  whitespace, the information presented is so spare.  \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> None of this would matter except that the main \"Training\"\r\n  navigation link at the top of the page points to the Training Log,\r\n  rather than the Training Calendar.  To get to the current month in\r\n  the Training Callendar, I have to click \"Training\", then click the\r\n  \"Training Calendar\" tab, then click on the month I want.  Ick.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> So I hacked together a quick user script that points the\r\n  \"Training\" nav link to the current month in the Training Calendar,\r\n  and I'm happy again.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I've also long been annoyed that the \"next month\" and \"previous month\" links in the Training Calendar can't cross year boundaries.  To get from Dec. 2013 to Jan. 2014, you have to click on 2013 to get to the year view, then click the link to the next year, then click on January.

My weight has\r\n  increased from around 186 to 188, and I've dropped from 20% body fat\r\n  to around 18.5%.  So, it seems that I've gained about 3 lbs. of\r\n  muscle, and dropped a pound or so of fat.  I'll take that, for now.\r\n  Once my lean body weight reaches 155 lbs. or so, it'll be time to\r\n  really focus on losing fat.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <a href=\"http://www.t-nation.com/article/performance_training/the_litvinov_workout\">Litvinovs</a>\r\n  should do the trick, but they'll also make me hate the universe and\r\n  everything in it.  So I'm saving those for the next time my wife\r\n  leaves town on business.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> So, it seems that everything is in place.  Nothing left to do but\r\n  simply do the work, and maybe switch to a more fat-burning weight\r\n  workout sometime in late February.  \"Bus bench training\" indeed.\r\n</p>\r\n"

So I opened\r\n  up <a href=\"http://smilesoftware.com/TextExpander/index.html\">TextExpander</a>,\r\n  and created a little library of snippets to do most of the work for\r\n  me.  (<a href=\"http://dreadedmonkeygod.net/home/attachments/tctp.textexpander\">Download\r\n  the snippet file</a>)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Now I can type, say, \"oux\"<sup><a href=\"#foot1\">1</a></sup>, and\r\n  TextExpander pops up the following dialogue:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center\">\r\n              <img alt=\"Fig. 1\" src=\"attachments/postcards/20140131-oux.jpg\">\r\n            </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p> I fill in the numbers, and hit <em>Return</em>, and TextExpander\r\n  formats everything thus:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n  3 x [12OU (2O/1U), 8RBI]\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p> That bit of gibberish denotes three twelve-minute \"OverUnder\"\r\n  intervals, alternating between two minutes of \"over\" intensity and\r\n  one minute of \"under\" intensity, with eight minutes at endurance\r\n  pace between intervals.  (You see now why the more terse notation is\r\n  used.)<sup><a href=\"#foot2\">2</a></sup>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I've created snippets for all the basic workout types, and added\r\n  another snippet to deal with workouts that require several \"sets\" of\r\n  intervals.

That means I need to\r\n  lose about 16 lbs. of fat, and gain about 6 lbs. of muscle.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> So my workout must maximize fat burning while keeping the muscle I\r\n  have, and maybe (<em>maybe</em>) building some muscle.  And I want\r\n  to keep volume reasonable because I'm\r\n  also <a href=\"archive/3021\">training on the bike</a>.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> So... <em>the plan</em>.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Barbell\r\n    Complex: <a href=\"http://www.tmuscle.com/free_online_article/sports_body_training_performance/screw_cardio_four_complexes_for_a_shredded_physique\">Cosgrove's\r\n      Evil 8</a></b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> The idea of a \"complex\" is that you pick up the weight and do all\r\n  the movements in one round without putting the weight down.  It's a\r\n  lot of work in a short amount of time, and your body is under\r\n  constant load, so it's a great way to burn fat and keep muscle.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I've been doing <em>Cosgrove's Evil 8</em>:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n  <li>deadlift</li>\r\n  <li>Romanian deadlift</li>\r\n  <li>bent-over row</li>\r\n  <li>power clean</li>\r\n  <li>front squat</li>\r\n  <li>push press</li>\r\n  <li>back squat</li>\r\n  <li>good morning</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p> The first round, you pick up the bar, do 6 reps of each movement,\r\n  then put the bar down.  Second round, do 5 reps reps of each.\r\n  Third, do 4, and so on.  Rest 90 seconds between rounds.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I've been doing this with a 55# barbell, and resting just 60\r\n  seconds between rounds.  \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I shortened the rest period because I found that 90 seconds was\r\n  too long for me.  The normal solution is to add more weight, but 55#\r\n  feels right to me (and I feel this workout for a day or two\r\n  afterward), so I'll start there and increase the load as strength\r\n  and recovery allow.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Loaded Carries: Farmer Walks</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> A farmer walk is dead simple: pick up something heavy in each\r\n  hand, and walk with it.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I do three \"sets\", where each set is:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n  <li>pick up a 50# weight in each hand</li>\r\n  <li>walk 60 yards</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p> I don't have space to walk 30 yards in a straight line, so I just\r\n  do laps around my back patio.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I don't have proper farmer walk handles, so I cut two lengths of\r\n  rope to make loops, and ran them through handles I made from\r\n  &frac34'' pipe.  Run the loops through the weights and use a rock\r\n  climbing knot to keep everything together, and presto: cheap-ass\r\n  farmer walks.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I'll keep doing these with 50# in each hand until they\r\n  feel <em>really</em> solid.  The loaded carry is a new movement for\r\n  me, so I'm being really conservative and giving my whole body time\r\n  to get used to this.\r\n</p>\r\n"

So it's complexes and farmer\r\n  walks.  And I'm going try kettle bell swings, because Dan John says\r\n  I should.  From <em>Intervention</em>:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n  I made a goal of 250 swings a day one month and everybody asked me\r\n  about my diet. It was awful and I ate and drank too much, but I\r\n  started looking pretty good from that little project of 250s.\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p> With a general weight training plan in place, I sat down with\r\n Chris\r\n Charmichael's <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Time-Crunched-Cyclist-2nd-Ed-Athlete-ebook/dp/B00A0D5WEQ/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1389117897&sr=8-1&keywords=time+crunched+cyclist\">The\r\n Time-Crunched Cyclist</a> to figure out the metabolic/bike side.  The\r\n lightest program still requires 6-8 hours of riding each week, which\r\n simply isn't going to happen.

I'm going to make them count.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I thought about trying to integrate my weight training with my\r\n  cycling, so that it all works together, but the result was a\r\n  scheduling train wreck.  As the TCTP scales up, it moves workouts\r\n  from alternating days to successive days and back again.  So finding\r\n  three perfect opportunities each week to hit the weights\r\n  is... problematic.  \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> So, I'm going to totally ignore the cycling schedule and just do\r\n  my weights like clockwork three days a week.  I'm going to\r\n  be <em>very</em> conservative about the intensity, and hope that the\r\n  reduced cycling volume (relative to both the textbook TCTP, and my\r\n  usual routine) will give my body a chance to recover from\r\n  everything.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Essentially, what this program boils down to is three\r\n  45-min. cycling workouts and three 30-min weight workouts each week.\r\n  I can handle that.\r\n</p>\r\n"

That's a <em>lot</em> of fat to carry around.  And I've been\r\n  carrying it around for <em>years</em>.  Time to leave it behind once\r\n  and for all.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> My target is 175# @ 12% body fat.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> The good news is that this means I need to <em>gain 6 lbs. of\r\nmuscle</em>.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Wait.  What?  \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Yeah.  To hit my target weight and composition, I need\r\nto <em>gain</em> muscle.

I personally\r\n  have an easier time gaining muscle than I do losing fat.  But it's\r\n  time to make it happen.  It's never going to be easier than it is\r\n  right now.

Bring the Movement to the Trainee</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Janell has been joining me in my weight lifting sessions\r\n  lately.  We've been working on the deadlift.

In effect,\r\n  bring the trainee to the exercise.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Jones has a better option: raise the weight off the floor until\r\n  the trainee <em>can</em> use proper form.  This is a great option.  It\r\n  lets you isolate strength and mobility and train them independently\r\n  without letting them interfere.  That's <em>awesome</em>.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>2. Better Bike Handling</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I've been reading Jamie Smith and Chris Horner's\r\n  book <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Reading-Race-Racing-Inside-Peloton-ebook/dp/B00GA9R2FQ/ref=sr_1_1_bnp_1_kin?ie=UTF8&qid=1386116716&sr=8-1&keywords=reading+the+race\">Reading\r\n    the Race</a>, about road bike racing and cycling technique.  I read\r\n  the following with horror:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n  I can easily spot someone who has done a lot of mountain\r\n  biking. He'll descend a hill with his feet located at 9 o'clock and\r\n  3 o'clock and his weight evenly distributed on the pedals. He may\r\n  have his butt off the saddle, too. He does this to absorb bumps on\r\n  the trail when he is mountain biking, but this position makes him\r\n  unstable on a road bike because it puts his weight high on the bike,\r\n  not down low, where it should be.\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p> That passage described me perfectly, and convinced me that Jamie\r\n  Smith knows what he's talking about. So I decided to give his\r\n  recommended form a try.  Happily, I have the perfect testing ground\r\n  in my back yard:\r\n  the <a href=\"http://www.strava.com/segments/636288\">Westlake Blvd\r\n    descent</a> from Mulholland Hwy.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> So, on Monday's ride I tried out Smith's recommended cornering\r\n  technique.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> This felt <em>really</em> different from mountain bike\r\n  downhill/cornering technique, so it spooked me at first.  But once I\r\n  got used to it, I felt <em>much</em> more stable than ever before.\r\n  I felt like I was riding really cautiously and under control, and\r\n  was still only 10 seconds slower than my fastest-ever descent of\r\n  that road.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Today, I did the same descent, and opened up the throttle a\r\n  little.  I still felt completely stable, even through the trickiest\r\n  corners.  And the steep section at the bottom, once described as\r\n  <a href=\"http://redkiteprayer.com/2013/04/riding-the-new-sram-p/\">twisting\r\n    like some ridiculous gag in a Road Runner cartoon</a>, felt nearly\r\n  straight.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> And the proof is in the pudding: after clocking in consistently at\r\n  about 5:30 for the last year, I finished today in 5:05, <em>twenty\r\n    seconds</em> faster than normal and fifteen seconds faster than my\r\n  previous PR, all while feeling more stable and in-control than ever\r\n  before.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>3.

(If I'm just a couple miles off shore, the same could\r\napply to a deep sea fishing trip.)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> And why limit it to just deliveries?  Why not pick-ups?  I'd love\r\nto be able to use drones to deliver small items across town.  If I\r\nleave my sunglasses at a party, I can have a drone visit the host's\r\nhouse to pick them up, and 30 minutes later they're in a little yellow\r\nbox on my back porch.  I'd <em>happily</em> pay for that. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Ditto for things like dropping small packages at UPS.  There's no\r\nreason for me to get in the car and drive to the store when a drone\r\nwill happily take the package to the shop for me.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I'd love to have the local dry cleaners use drones for pickup and\r\ndelivery.  Why not use Amazon's drones the way we use UPS's trucks?\r\n</p>\r\n"

Time to check the results, and\r\n  see what's next.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>The Program</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> The routine was dead simple.  Twice I week, for six weeks, I\r\n  walked into my garage and did:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li>Deadlift: 3 x 3 @ 90% 1RM</li>\r\n  <li>Romanian Deadlift: 3 x 3 @ 90% 1RM</li>\r\n  <li>Press: 3 x 3 @ 90% 1RM</li>\r\n  <li>Bent-Over Row: 3 x 3 @ 90% 1RM</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>The Results</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I intentionally started out with lighter loads than I could have.\r\n  I've talked about how <a href=\"archive/2892\">cycling doesn't develop\r\n  eccentric strength</a>.  And I was determined to follow my own\r\n  rule: <em>When starting something new, go easy.</em>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> That said, the results are still pretty good.  I've added 100# to\r\n  my deadlift and 90# to my Romanian deadlift, and 30# to my military\r\n  press, which I'm happy with.  And while I've added 4# of body\r\n  weight, my body measurements (thighs, hips, chest, waist) are\r\n  all <em>exactly</em> the same.  So I got what I wanted: strength\r\n  increases with minimal bulk.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>What's next?</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> It's time to back off on the weights and let my body recover from\r\n  six weeks of hard work.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I <em>hope</em> a stronger posterior chain translates to more\r\n  speed on the bike, but I'm not expecting anything major.  Six weeks\r\n  of basic strength work isn't going to move mountains.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Just the same, all my big PRs are from early this Summer, so I'm\r\n  itching to post some new times.  And I want to attack some of the\r\n  major local road climbs that I haven't done yet.

So I'm going to try 2 x 2 @ 3RM twice a week.  That\r\n  should lower the total volume by about 60%, and let my body recover\r\n  from the last few weeks of accumulated fatigue and be fresh for\r\n  cycling.  We shall see.\r\n</p>\r\n"

It's\r\n  been happening once or twice each ride for a while, but last night\r\n  was a total mess.  It's officially time to do something about this.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Between the newness of night riding and the pedal problems, I\r\n  chickened out of trying the Sheep Corral downhill.  I split from the\r\n  rest of the group and headed back down the Canyon\r\n  trail.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Maybe I've just read too many accident reports in climbing\r\n  magazines, but when I see two risk factors stack up, I don't wait\r\n  for the third.  I've learned to draw a solid line\r\n  between <em>challenging</em> and <em>risky</em>, and to be\r\n  conservative with where I draw it.  The worst that's ever happened\r\n  to me on a mountain bike was a <a href=\"archive/1731\">gnarly\r\n  scrape</a>, and I aim to keep it that way.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> In any event, riding a little on my own was a great chance to\r\n  really get used to riding with the lights, and I found that after\r\n  just a few minutes I was really comfortable, and I even logged a PR\r\n  time from <a href=\"http://www.strava.com/segments/5739955\">Shepherd's\r\n  flat through Sulphur Springs</a>.  Strangely, I never felt like I\r\n  was really pushing the pace, just riding smooth and trying to pick\r\n  super-clean lines.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I ended up reaching Bell Canyon Fire Rd. just ahead of the others,\r\n  and we rode the rest of the way back to the trailhead together.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> So, I'm hooked.  The notion of after-work rides during the winter\r\n  makes me really happy, so I'm planning on getting my own lights\r\n  soon.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> And I've submitted an RMA with Crank Brothers so that they can\r\n  have a look at my pedal and decide what to do.\r\n</p>\r\n",

I've got all the tools I need, a few boxes of\r\nspare parts, and plenty of space.  I've also been using\r\na <a href=\"https://www.ridgid.com/us/en/flip-top-portable-work-support\">flip-top\r\nportable support</a> as a bike stand, which makes working on the\r\nbike <em>much</em> easier.  And, I have a selection of bungee cords to\r\nhold the bike in whatever position I need.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I started using my music stand as a portable table.  The\r\nstand-table combination is <em>killer</em> for working comfortably and\r\nquickly.  \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I replaced the front and rear brake pads, bled the brakes, and\r\nreplaced the rear rotor.

So I ordered a replacement, which should arrive\r\ntomorrow.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> And since I have a suspect GPS anyway, there was little risk in\r\nopening up the unit to clean out the gunk that seeped into it on\r\na <a href=\"archive/2796\">rainy ride back in January</a>.  Some\r\npatience, isopropyl, and cotton swaps, and it's as good as new.  I'm\r\nreally hoping that the new heart rate monitor restores everything to\r\nfull working order.

Even at\r\n    maximum intensity, you're talking about hundreds or thousands of\r\n    reps.\r\n  </li>\r\n\r\n  <li>No matter how tired I am, I can still crank out a three-rep\r\n    set.\r\n  </li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p> So I put my trust in my experience and knowledge, and did both.\r\n</p>\r\n",
    "body": "<p> I'm <em>well</em>-adapted to work on the bike, so I'm not worried\r\n  about bike-related fatigue and recovery interfering with my strength\r\n  work.  And the literature says that as long as you separate\r\n  aerobic/endurance work from strength work by at least an hour, they\r\n  won't interfere with each other.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I picked <a href=\"archive/2931\">taller gears</a> for the Black Cyn\r\n  climb, and stood for much of it.  As a result, I was nearly a minute\r\n  off my PR pace.  Oh well.  I've been spinning the small gears long\r\n  enough.  Nothing left to do but click up a notch and push, even if\r\n  I'm slower in the short term.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> In the weight room, on the other hand, last night's numbers\r\n  encouraging. I definitely got stronger over last week (same weights\r\n  feel lighter), but that's to be expected at the start of a strength\r\n  cycle.  You gain strength fast at first, then make steady progress\r\n  for a few weeks, and finally level out as your body gets inured to\r\n  the workout and <a href=\"archive/2878\">stops adapting</a>.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> So, we'll see how this goes.  But I'm going to have to buy more\r\n  weights: I deadlifted everything I own last night.  (Don't be\r\n  impressed. \"Everything I own\" weighs just 160#.)  So I'm going to\r\n  need more for Thursday.  Nice problem to have.\r\n</p>\r\n"

I remember this from music\r\n  school.  So much of playing a brass instrument is muscle memory,\r\n  knowing <em>exactly</em> how to set your lips and lungs to account\r\n  for intonation, volume, timbre, and emphasis.  And when you get\r\n  stronger, everything veers off kilter for a few days while your\r\n  muscles acustom themselves to their new strength.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> This is true for cycling, too.  Turning the cranks is done largely\r\n  by muscle memory.  You learn how to get the most speed out of your\r\n  body, how leg strength, heart rate and pedal cadence balance each\r\n  other to propel the bike forward.  You learn how to listen to your\r\n  body to know just how hard you can push.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> The weight work I'm doing has started paying off, and my legs are\r\n  noticably stronger.  It's changing the leg/lung/heart balance, and\r\n  I'm having to learn how to <em>use</em> that new strength.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Cycling's bottom line is that if you want to go faster, you have\r\n  to shift up a gear.  With stronger legs, the time has come to reach\r\n  for taller gears.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> So after <a href=\"archive/2929\">climbing Johnson Fire Rd.</a> on\r\n  Sunday, I decided to push my legs a little bit.  I picked gears just\r\n  too hard for my legs.  When I was comfortable, I shifted up a gear.\r\n  I found that a slower cadence <em>feels</em> strange, but I can push\r\n  at that cadence far longer than I expected.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> And I was faster.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> (I wish I'd done that same experiment on Johnson.  Oh well.  Next\r\n  time.)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Today <a href=\"http://www.strava.com/activities/84907815#1744332383\">I\r\n    took about 30 seconds off an 8-min. climb</a>.  My average speed\r\n  jumped from 5.9 to 6.4 mph.  And I did it by intentionally picking\r\n  gears that felt too tall.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> So, just like back in music school, it's time to reset my muscle\r\n  memory.  \r\n</p>\r\n",

So I did likewise.  (There\r\nare <em>many</em> trails in L.A. and Ventura county that lie on\r\nprivate land, and are similarly marked, but which are freely used by\r\nall, with the understanding that a fence will go up if we don't behave\r\nourselves.)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I met a nice guy on the switchbacks who cautioned me to be extra\r\nnice to anyone on horseback.  \"I don't really care that you're here,\r\nbut you really should slow almost to a stop if you meet any horses.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I did a little Googling when I got home, and the area is owned by\r\na <a href=\"http://www.bp-hoa.org/\">horse-oriented housing tract</a>,\r\nand they've reserved it entirely for \"equine and pedestrian\r\nactivities.\"  I have to raise an eyebrow at the fact that they've\r\nrestricted what <em>activities</em> are permitted, rather than reserve\r\nthe trails for <em>residents</em>, but it's their land, and they can\r\ndo whatever they want.  And the point is moot: given the\r\nsometimes-tense relations between equestrians and mountain bikers, I\r\nwon't antagonize anyone by venturing up this canyon again.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Still, it is one of the most beautiful canyons in Simi, and the\r\nclimb up to Albertson was challenging.  My legs\r\nwere <a href=\"archive/2922\">anything but fresh</a>, but the beauty of\r\na 36-tooth sprocket is that it turns regardless of how tired you are.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Sparing the legs up Bus Canyon cost me time, and I simply ran out\r\nof daylight and had to take the First St. sidewalk back to Challenger\r\nPark.  It's full dark by 7:45 these days, cutting short a lot of\r\nafter-work rides.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I still want to get in a couple more Rock Store loops before DST\r\nofficially ends on November 3.

I\r\n  know better than to expect progress after just a few days, and the\r\n  other night I caught myself thinking, <em>I really want some\r\n  cookies.  If I've lost weight, then I can have them.</em>  Not\r\n  wanting to let success justify self-sabotage, I refused to weigh in.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I do know that I've eaten relatively well.

She had to put in a few hours of work yesterday afternoon,\r\n  which left me with some time to kill.  \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> So I headed for the hotel gym, a tiny, cramped space squeezed into\r\n  the third floor near the lap pool.  It was as if someone had put\r\n  seven Nautilus machines in a hotel room.  Actually, I think that's\r\n  exactly what they did.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I warmed up with some core/ab/shoulder stuff on a Swiss ball, then\r\n  did some side-steps with a resistance band.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> The main workout was a modified verison\r\n  of <a href=\"http://www.t-nation.com/free_online_article/sports_body_training_performance/screw_cardio_four_complexes_for_a_shredded_physique\">Cosgrove's\r\n  Evil 8</a> complex: 5 rounds, 8 reps of each movement, with a pair\r\n  of 20# dumbbells.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n  <li>deadlift</li>\r\n  <li>Romanian deadlift</li>\r\n  <li>bent-over row</li>\r\n  <li>power clean</li>\r\n  <li>front squat</li>\r\n  <li>push press</li>\r\n  <li>front squat</li>\r\n  <li>straight-leg deadlift</li>\r\n  <li>rest 90 seconds</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p> So that's 8 reps * 8 movements * 5 rounds = 320 reps.  Multiply by\r\n  40# to get volume: 12,800#.  And the whole thing took less than 25\r\n  minutes.  (30 if you include warm-ups.)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I left the hotel gym covered in sweat and a little wobbly.  And today I'm sore, even in places that I didn't think I worked especially hard.

I haven't been out for\r\na truly big (for me) ride for ages (years?), and\r\nit's <em>definitely</em> different experience from the usual 2-hour\r\ncrankfest.\r\n</p>\r\n",
    "body": "<p> <b>Endurance</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I wanted to see how my endurance would fare.  Chris Charmichael\r\nmentions in his book <em>The Time-Crunched Cyclist</em> that\r\nlow-volume, high-intensity training has its place, but there tends to\r\nbe a drop-off in performance around the three-hour mark.\r\nI <em>definitely</em> felt that.  I felt reasonably good until Kanan\r\nRd, but after that I really had no power.  Even short climbs that I\r\nusually roll in my middle ring became heart-pumping efforts.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> However, my time from Kanan to Encinal was reasonable.  So while\r\nI <em>felt</em> horrible, I wasn't seriously off my usual pace.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> It's after Encinal that I really started to slow down.  <em>Ten\r\nminutes</em> off my PR from Mulholland to Etz.  That's pretty\r\nterrible.  And that jibes with where I really started feeling tired\r\nand thirsty.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> So, in the future, I know I <em>must</em> stay hydrated.  The rule\r\nof thumb is \"one bottle per hour\" (~20 oz), but I think for me it's\r\nmore like \"one <em>liter</em> per hour.\"  And from now on I'm going to\r\nstay away from anything longer than an hour on hot days.  I've had my\r\nfill of dusty, thirsty grinds.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Interesting wrinkle: elevation also contributes to dehydration.\r\nThat'll come into play on Mt. Whitney next month, and if I ever do\r\nLeadville.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Food</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I followed the standard \"15/30\" Gu plan for yesterday's ride: I\r\nate a Gu ~15 minutes before starting, and every 30 minutes or so\r\nduring the ride.  I ate a waffle at the top of Bulldog (around the\r\n1:30 min. mark), and at the Kanan Rd. trailhead (~2:30).  That seemed\r\nto keep me going pretty well.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I ended up pushing through the last hour or so on the bike (from\r\nMulholland on) with only about 12 oz. of water left.  I'd ride for 5\r\nmin, take a sip, ride for 5 min, take a sip, etc.  I knew I'd be fine,\r\nbut man... that wasn't fun.  I finished the last of my water just as I\r\ngot in sight of the car.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I drank about 40 oz of water within 30 minutes of finishing the\r\nride, and drank a 200 cal. portion of chocolate milk before jumping in\r\nthe shower (about 40 min. after finishing).  After that, I sipped\r\nwater pretty constantly until I was well hydrated again.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I had a bowl of whole grain pasta with a couple of meatballs about\r\n90 minutes after finishing, and another a few hours after that,\r\nfollowed by a few cookies and a glass of milk.  Today, I don't notice\r\nany residual energy drain.  I can definitely feel that I worked hard\r\nyesterday, but walking up stairs isn't any harder than usual.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Stretching</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> After walking the dogs (about 8:30 at night), I went through my\r\nusual <a href=\"archive/2889\">stretching routine</a>.  I wish I'd done\r\nthis earlier-- it <em>really</em> helped relaxy my back and hips and\r\nsettle me down for the night.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Overall</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> So, the nutshell: nutrition and recovery seem pretty\r\nsolid. Hydration needs work, but that's an easy fix.  And if I plan on\r\ndoing rides longer than 4 hours, I need to add more volume.  Good to\r\nknow, but not a change I'm likely to make in the near term-- I just\r\ndon't have the time to log many long rides.  So I'll start with the\r\nhigher-volume training if/when I'm training for an event that requires\r\nit.\r\n</p>\r\n"

    "intro": "<p> More tired after this ride I've been in ages.  It was much hotter\r\nand drier than I expected.  I'd brought two full water bottles, plus\r\ntwo frozen 20 oz. water bottles, plus a regular 20 oz. bottle.  Despite\r\nall that, it was looking like bailing down Kanan Rd. to Rock Store was\r\ngoing to be the smart move.  But I to managed to bum some water off a\r\ncouple of mountain bikers who were finishing their ride at the Kanan\r\nRd. trailhead.  (Note to self: play \"trail angel\" this week and drop\r\nsome water bottles at a couple of the Backbone trailheads.)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I had been told that there was a water spigot at the fire station\r\nnear the Encinal Cyn tailhead.

    "intro": "<p> It's been a crazy few weeks.  I came home\r\nfrom <a href=\"archive/2912\">Maui</a> with <em>plans</em>, man.\r\nUnfortunately, I also came home with a cold that killed my training\r\nplans, and sucked away all the motivation I had for my nutritional\r\nplans.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> But a few things got done.  There's an updated weight set in the\r\ngarage. And the garage now has plenty of space for those weights.\r\n(Nearly ready for <em>cars</em>, if you can believe that!)  And I'm\r\ngetting close to having all the gear I need for a hike up Mt. Whitney\r\nin October.  \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> And, with my cold finally on its way out, it's time to get back on\r\ntrack.  I've been aiming to get my weight under 180 lbs. for a while\r\nnow.  I've been hovering around 184.  Time to get the rest of the way\r\nto where I want to be.  Under 180 is the plan for 2013.  I'll aim for\r\n175 in 2014.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> So what does that mean?\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> It means eating right.  I've been eating take-out the last couple\r\nof weeks, and that's not going to help.  I aim for stuff that's\r\nnot <em>horrible</em>, but still.  A Red Robin burger isn't on\r\nanyone's health food list.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> So I'll get back on the program of steak, polenta, spinach salads,\r\nrice, grilled chicken, and plenty of whole grain pasta.\r\n(Yes, <em>pasta</em>.  Think that's a mistake?  I don't care.)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> And it means riding.  No problem there.  But it also means\r\nmaintaining a daily caloric deficit, so I'll have to dial down my\r\nperformance expectations.  I probably won't be setting major new PRs\r\nfor a while.  \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> And it means lifting.  I'll be doing complexes, mostly.  The\r\nnotion is that you pick up a barbell (or dumbells, or a t-handle, or\r\nyour dog) and do several exercises in succession without stopping or\r\nputting the weight down.  So you might pick up a barbell, and do:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li> deadlift: 5 @ 65#</li>\r\n  <li> Romanian deadlift: 5 @ 65#</li>\r\n  <li> bent-over row: 5 @ 65#</li>\r\n  <li> front squat: 5 @ 65#</li>\r\n  <li> push press: 5 @ 65#</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p> Rest for 60 seconds, then go again.  Do 5 repeats.  (Or more, if\r\nyou're macho.)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Full-body workout in ~15 minutes.  And here's the kicker: it\r\ncranks up your body's metabolism for <em>hours</em> afterward.  I've\r\ndone workouts like this, and more than two hours later I'm still a\r\nwalking furnace, too overheated to sleep with the covers on.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> And somewhere in there, I'll be doing some hiking with a heavy\r\n(~40 lbs) pack to get ready for Mt. Whitney.  \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> So, here's the $64 question: <em>Who cares?</em>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I'm putting this here, right out in public in front of everyone so\r\nthat I'll have to follow through.  I'm planning on a long bike ride on\r\nMonday, and in the meantime I've got to do some meal planning and\r\ngrocery shopping.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> The key here is to have everything already planned, so there's no\r\ndecision-making involved once <em>the business</em> starts.  Because\r\nwhen I'm four days in, and heading home after a bike ride, I'm going\r\nto think, <em>In-n-Out for me tonight!</em> and my whole plan will go\r\nstraight to hell.  Oh, no.  I'm not letting that happen.  I'm going to\r\nhave left-over pasta with sun-dried tomatoes and pesto and some\r\ngrilled chicken on top waiting in the fridge so I don't even have to\r\nthink about it.  \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Time to go to sleep.

(I haven't lifted regularly in six years or so.)  But\r\n  I've got to be patient. There's a weird little gremlin that lurks in\r\n  the weight room, hunting cyclists.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> His name: the <em>eccentric contraction</em>.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> There are two phases to a typical lift: the part where you pick\r\n  the weight up is called the <em>concentric</em> phase, where your\r\n  muscles <em>contract</em> under load.  And the part where you put\r\n  the weight down is called the <em>eccentric</em> phase, where your\r\n  muscles <em>release</em> under load.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> In cycling, <em>there is no eccentric</em> phase.  A cyclist's\r\n  muscles never have to release while under a load.  This leads to a\r\n  weird imbalance: our legs are well-adapted for <em>lifting</em>\r\n  weights, but not to <em>putting them down again.</em>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> When a cyclist hits the weight room for the first time, they\r\n  typically lift a bunch of heavy weight, and end\r\n  up <em>incredibly</em> sore and weak afterward (if they're lucky),\r\n  or tear a muscle and end up injured (if they're not).\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> The smart cyclist (like me, naturally) knows that he needs to\r\n  bring his eccentric strength into balance with his concentric\r\n  strength before he can train with heavy weights.  Once I'm able to\r\n  fully recover within 48 hours with minimal soreness, <em>then</em>\r\n  I'll increase the load.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Eventually, I'll do the following twice a week:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li>goblet squats: 2x2@90%</li>\r\n  <li>split squat: 2x2@90%</li>\r\n  <li>romainian deadlift: 2x2@90%</li>\r\n  <li>one-hand row: 2x5@80#</li>\r\n  <li>push-up: 2x10@bodyweight</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p> Load and reps target strength, low total volume keeps me fresh for\r\n  a couple of hard bike rides each week.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Ideally I'll get into a groove where I work strength the\r\n  day <em>after</em> a big bike ride, like so:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li>big ride</li>\r\n  <li>weight training</li>\r\n  <li>recovery ride</li>\r\n  <li>day off/recovery ride</li>\r\n  <li>repeat</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p> This arrangement <em>does</em> compromise strength gains.\r\n  However, I believe the compromise will be minimal.  My experience\r\n  has been that I can produce high-quality strength work even while\r\n  fatigued from a bike ride, as long as the volume of strength work is\r\n  low.  (In the words of an old trainer:\r\n  <em>You can always find another two-rep set.</em>)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I went for a ride yesterday, with some interesting results.  I was\r\n  slow as hell along Cornell, but once I warmed up, I\r\n  felt <em>much</em> better.  Not strong, but endurance was fine.  On\r\n  <a href=\"http://app.strava.com/activities/62666561\">Rock Store</a> I\r\n  was ~1:20 off my PR, which is substantial.  So it's clear that my\r\n  top-end performance will suffer while I'm getting used to the\r\n  weights, but I can still ride and enjoy myself, which is great.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> This is going to be an interesting journey...\r\n</p>\r\n"

Take a\r\n  short break. Repeat.\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p> Nikola knows what he's doing.  So I knew <em>something</em> in my\r\nunderstanding was wrong.  I'd misread R&amp;K, or misunderstood\r\nNikola's workout, or there was some constraint (injury, flexibility,\r\nmuscle imbalance, etc.) that led Nikola to choose a squat/leg curl\r\nsuperset over a traditional deep squat.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> So I posted a comment, and Nikola was \r\n<a href=\"http://www.thetallcyclist.com/2013/03/cycling-strength-series-5-explosive-power-build/\">kind\r\nenough to enlighten me</a>.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> The answer: the adaptation principle.  Or, as some workout systems\r\ncall it, muscle confusion.  If you do the same movements long enough,\r\nyour body gets used to it, and strength/power gains slow down, and\r\neventually stop.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Nikola is varying his workout to make sure his body never\r\nacclimates to a set routine.  Adding variations is extremely smart,\r\nand easy to forget.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> So, once again, it comes back to trade-offs.  Squats are awesome,\r\nbut if you do them too much, the awesome wears off.  So it's smart to\r\nhave a handful of squat variations in your back pocket, and use them\r\njudiciously.\r\n</p>\r\n",

The overwhelming\r\nfactor in the performance of the bike is <em>the rider</em>.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Fuel Properly</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> A strong ride and quick recovery start with proper\r\nfueling <em>during your ride</em>.  Hydrate and stay fueled.  Recovery\r\nstarts at the top of the day's last climb.  That's a great moment to\r\nhave a snack and get a jump on the nutrients your body will be\r\nscreaming for later.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Cool Down</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Finish every hard ride with 10-15 minutes of easy spinning.\r\n(Heart rate under 140 bpm.)

Giving your body the fuel it needs exactly when\r\nit needs it is <em>immensely</em> effective.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I tend to sweat a <em>lot</em>, so I make sure to get plenty of\r\nwater, especially after a ride.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Do Recovery Rides</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Moderate activity increases your muscle cells' insulin\r\nsensitivity, which pulls glucose from the blood into muscles' glycogen\r\nstores more effectively than if you're sedentary.  But the activity\r\nmust be <em>moderate</em>, or it defeats the purpose.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Flats Kill Speed</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> The average speed of a cyclist with a flat is <em>zero mph</em>.\r\nI run tubeless on my mountain bike, and I use Gator Skins tires on my\r\nroad bike.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Laundry is Not Optional</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Use a sports-specific laundry soap (I like Penguin Wash) to\r\nkeep <em>the stank</em> off your gear.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Do Your Own Wrenching</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Get the tools you need.

It's called Westlake Road [sic] and to my\r\n  knowledge it has the single steepest pitch in all of the Santa\r\n  Monicas. The road pitches downward at an incredible 20 percent.

This, in fact,\r\n\tis what many coaches and trainers believe and advise their\r\n\tathletes to do, in more sports than cycling. This is\r\n\tmisguided. The problem here is a misunderstanding of the exercise\r\n\tand its relationship to the sport skill: a partial squat does not\r\n\tproduce a strong hamstring contraction. Any cyclist who does\r\n\tpartial squats is not developing balanced strength around the knee\r\n\tand is neglecting the muscles used in the hip-extension aspect of\r\n\ta properly executed pedaling cycle. [...] So although the partial\r\n\tsquat may superficially look more specific, in anatomical action\r\n\tand in the quality of muscular function and development the more\r\n\tgeneralized full squat is more applicable to the activity. The\r\n\taddition of leg curls to the program is not the answer; correct\r\n\tanalysis of the squat is.\r\n  </p>\r\n\r\n  <span class=\"attribution\">- <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Practical-Programming-Strength-Training-Rippetoe/dp/0982522703/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1343159980&sr=8-1\">Rippetoe &amp; Kilgore</a></span>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p> \"Sport-specific\" training means targeting the most applicable\r\n  muscular and metabolic aptitudes.  It means giving stability,\r\n  lateral movement, or plyometrics more or less emphasis.  It\r\n  does <em>not</em> mean doing weird half-movements or pretending\r\n  you're on your bike when you're not.  If you're riding regularly,\r\n  you're getting <em>plenty</em> of \"sport-specific movement.\"  \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Want a squat variant that's more cycling-specific?  How about\r\n  a <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CvEs-TOIKM\">Bulgarian split\r\n    squat</a>?  Full range of motion, similar angle, and <em>some</em>\r\n  instability.

Orcutt's office to verify.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> The first assertion is just crazy.  The second is plain wrong, and\r\nState Representative Orcutt should know better.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I've <a href=\"archive/2771\">talked before</a> about how local\r\nroads are paid for in California, and it turns out that Washington\r\nState does it much the same way.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> In Washington\r\nState, <a href=\"http://taxfoundation.org/article/gasoline-taxes-and-tolls-pay-only-third-state-local-road-spending\">only\r\nabout 33.5% of road funding comes from fuel, tolls, and other use\r\ntaxes and fees</a>.  About 66% of funding from local roads comes from\r\nlocal governments' general funds, which are fed chiefly by sales\r\ntax.  <a href=\"http://www.sale-tax.com/KalamaWA\">Kalama, WA has a\r\nsales tax of 7.6%.</a>, so when you buy a $500 bike in Representative\r\nOrcutt's district, you've <em>already kicked in $38</em> to help pay for\r\nroads.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> And every time the owner of that bike buys anything new for their\r\nbike, they kick in even more.  Every new tube, tire, light, lock,\r\nhelmet, and bottle of chain grease helps pay for the roads that\r\ncyclists use.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Cyclists impose\r\njust <a href=\"http://www.vtpi.org/whoserd.pdf\">$0.002</a>\r\n(that's <em>two tenths of a cent</em>) of maintenance costs on roads\r\nfor every mile ridden.  At that rate, $38 in sales tax pays for 19,000\r\nmiles.  Every $1 in sales tax pays for 500 miles' worth of bike rides.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <a href=\"http://www.seattlebikeblog.com/2013/03/04/rep-orcutt-says-bicycle-carbon-emissions-not-a-point-worthy-of-even-mentioning/\">Representative\r\nOrcutt did correct his mistake</a> regarding the pollution produced by\r\ncyclsts.  But he reaffirmed his misunderstanding of how roads get\r\nfunded, and how cyclists contribute to that funding:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\nHowever, the one aspect of the Democrat tax plan that has merit is\r\ntheir proposed $25.00 tax on the purchase of any bicycle $500.00 or\r\nmore. I am willing to consider this because I've heard requests from\r\nmembers of the bicycle community that they want more money for bicycle\r\ninfrastructure. The idea of bicyclists paying for some of the\r\ninfrastructure they are using is one which merits consideration.\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p> And that's what drives me nuts.  I'm happy to talk about how\r\nbike-friendly infrastructure project should be funded, but let's at\r\nleast start with the truth: cyclists <em>do</em> help pay for the\r\nroads.\r\n</p>\r\n",

It talks about various workouts\r\nand what metabolic and muscular aptitudes they target, and how to use\r\nhigh-intensity, low-volume training.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Until now, I'd been totally convinced that \"base miles\", or \"long,\r\nsteady distance\" rides were a bad time investment.  The arguments for\r\nthis point of view are persuasive.  First, high-intensity training\r\ntriggers the same physiological adaptations in a fraction of the\r\ntraining time.  Second, high-intensity training allows more time for\r\nrecovery, and avoids the grind on your body caused by all those miles,\r\nand hours, in the saddle.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> But Charmichael notes an important (and unsurprising) drawback of\r\nhigh-intensity, low-volume training is that long-haul endurance isn't\r\ndeveloped.  Long-haul performance requires a strong aerobic\r\nmetabolism, which is best developed by high-volume, LSD training.  So, essentially: my easy lunch loops only <em>looked</em> like a waste of time because I haven't done a ride more than a couple hours long in a while.  They develop aptitudes I'm not measuring.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> So, what does this mean for me?\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I've resumed my easy recovery rides: my legs are responding well\r\nto the interval training I'm doing, and I want to be sure I get enough\r\nvolume to maintain my aerobic metabolism and recovery ability.\r\nInterestingly, I'm going <em>easier</em> on these rides, making sure\r\nto stay well below my lactate threshold.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> And my interval workouts will be getting an adjustment.  I'm\r\nresting too long between work intervals to get the most out of the\r\nmetabolic aspect.  I do a 2 min. effort, then rest for 3\r\nminutes.  <em>But.</em>  I want the intervals to target <em>leg\r\nstrength</em> above all else, and starting a work interval before I'm\r\nfully recharged compromises that goal.

GSP, on the other hand, was already using blackout\r\ncurtains and artificial daylight lamps to live on Las Vegas time.\r\nThat was what won me over: GSP was seriously smart, and using\r\neverything he knew to prepare.

I think I'm just\r\na <em>little</em> crazy, though.  I have nice bike gear that keeps me\r\npretty comfortable.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> And I'm a little extra-motivated today.  I've been reading Chris\r\nCharmichael's <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/The-Time-Crunched-Cyclist-2nd-ebook/dp/B00A0D5WEQ/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&ie=UTF8&qid=1359154794&sr=1-1&keywords=time-crunched+cyclist\">The\r\nTime-Crunched Cyclist</a>, and he emphasizes the importance of keeping\r\nworkouts in sync with your recovery cycle:\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n[Back when Charmichael was racing,] Monday was a rest day, Tuesday was\r\nsprinting, Wednesday was a long day, Thursday was for hills, and\r\nFriday was a short ride to rest up for racing or group rides on the\r\nweekends. The limitation of that program was that there was never\r\nenough load on any one energy system to lead to significant growth. A\r\nfull week was too long to wait between climbing repeats for one\r\nworkout to build on the benefits from the previous one.\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p> I've seen similar results in <a href=\"archive/2787\">my own\r\ndata</a>.  Doing two workouts a week triggers consistent improvement.\r\nBut doing <em>one</em> workout a week doesn't cut that improvement in\r\nhalf; it cuts it to <em>zero</em>.  The benefits of that lone workout\r\nhave blossomed and withered by the time the week is out.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> So, today's the day.  I rode on Tuesday, and today is officially\r\n<em>go time</em>: the third day after an interval workout, the day\r\nthat I'm usually hitting the small peak after a workout.  So I ride in\r\nthe rain, because if I don't, I'll be right back where I was on\r\nTuesday, scratching out that same small fitness gain all over again.\r\n</p>\r\n",

    "intro": "<p> I've been doing interval workouts on my bike.  I ride uphill as\r\nfast as I can for two minutes, then I rest for three minutes. Then I\r\ngo again.  I do three reps, and I'm done.  I measure progress by how\r\nfar up the hill I get.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I've been putting my bike in the same gear every time I do this\r\nworkout.  But I think I need to reconsider that.\r\n</p>\r\n",
    "body": "<p> By keeping the same gear ratio, the only way to increase distance\r\ntraveled pedaling <em>faster</em>.  That's not what I really want.  I\r\nwant more <em>force</em> through the pedals at the <em>same</em>\r\ncadence.  \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> On my first hill repeat workout, I covered 0.24 miles at a 1.58\r\n(30x19) gear ratio.  That means I turned the cranks 110 times, for a\r\ncadence of 55 rpm.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> On my most recent workout, I covered 0.29 miles at the same gear\r\nratio.  So I turned the cranks 134 times at 67 rpm.  That's a 20%\r\ndifference.  \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> So, what's really getting overloaded here?  The balance is\r\nshifting off leg strength and onto cardiorespiratory capability.\r\nThat's not what I want.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> So it's time to bump up a gear or two, and keep the focus on my\r\nlegs.  I need to make sure I stay below 60 rpm.  (Nothing magical\r\nabout 60 rpm; it's just where I'm comfortable pushing really hard.)\r\nIn the end, that will keep the emphasis on building stronger legs, and\r\nmy distance will <em>still</em> be a good barometer for how I'm\r\nprogressing: as I get stronger, my cadence will get faster, and I'll\r\ngo farther.  When I get fast enough that I need to shift up a gear to\r\nmaintain a 60 rpm cadence, I'll do so.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Now, I <em>could</em> take my cue from weight lifting and time how\r\nlong it takes me to do the <em>same</em> number of strokes.  When it\r\ngets too fast, I go up a gear.  That would <em>really</em> keep the\r\nemphasis on building leg strength.  <em>But</em>.  I didn't pick the\r\n2-minute time randomly.  It's the typical point where muscles run out\r\nof available fuel.  So, I'm building leg strength <em>and</em>\r\ntraining up the metabolic processes that will let me push hard not\r\njust once or twice, but over and over again during a\r\nride.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> So, I'll keep the two-minute set duration, and the three-minute\r\nrest period.  The only adjustment I'm making is that I'll be adjusting\r\nmy gearing to stay under 60 rpm.\r\n</p>\r\n"

    "intro": "<p> In the last few months, I've switched from a very free-form\r\nprogram to something <em>much</em> more\r\nstructured.  <a href=\"archive/2787\">Interval training</a> is now part\r\nof my weekly routine, and the results so far have been very promising.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> But I haven't been consistent.  I need <em>two</em> workouts each\r\nweek to get stronger, and I've only gotten that during three of the\r\nlast five weeks.  And I lost a whole week to allergies.  \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> So it was time to get my bearings again, which meant\r\nclimbing <a href=\"http://dreadedmonkeygod.net/home/maps/20120718-bulldog.gpx\">Bulldog</a>.\r\n</p>\r\n",
    "body": "<p> I set a new PR: 42:49, a minute faster than my old PR.  But after\r\nfive months of training, that's a disappointment.  Over the summer, I\r\nwas improving by about 2% each month.  Projected out to yesterday, I\r\nshould have logged a time around 37:40, nearly <em>six minutes</em>\r\nfaster than my old PR.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> But there are signs that I haven't been wasting my time.  I\r\nfelt <em>much</em> stronger on the upper legs of the climb.  Bulldog\r\nis usually an all-out effort for me.  I restrained myself a bit\r\nyesterday because after months of really short workouts, I wondered if\r\nI'd simply implode half way up the climb.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> As it turns out, I didn't implode.  What <em>really</em> has me\r\nexcited is how I felt (and performed) <em>after</em> Bulldog, riding\r\nup Castro Mtwy to the \"private property\" sign.  I climbed all of that\r\nin my middle ring, pushing hard up the climbs and standing to keep my\r\nmomentum going.  I felt <em>really</em> strong, which tells me it's\r\ntime to pick some more aggressive gearing coming up Bulldog, and that\r\nI <em>could</em> have put more energy into climbing Bulldog.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Like my last ride up <a href=\"archive/2786\">Johnson Fire Rd.</a>,\r\nI think I need to relearn how to use my legs.  Experience tells me\r\nthat once I burn a match, I won't recover.  But several times on\r\nBulldog I felt fresh after just 30 or 40 seconds of easier pedaling,\r\neven pedaling that <em>used</em> to wear me down.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> So, I'm hopeful that my first run up Bulldog was more of a test\r\nrun than a real effort.  I'll give it two weeks and have another go,\r\nand we'll see where I really stand.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> In the meantime, I'll be making some adjustments to my normal\r\nworkout routine.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <a href=\"archive/2707\">R&amp;K</a> says that endurance efforts\r\n(like Bulldog) don't interfere with short-burst training as long as\r\nyou allow some space between workouts.  (As little as one hour will\r\ndo.)  So I'm not going to \"go easy\" any more while I'm recovering from\r\na Bulldog ride.  It's back to the intervals tomorrow.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> And I'm going to use a higher gear during my intervals.  I've been\r\ncareful to use the same gear each time, but at some point, going\r\nfaster means pushing bigger gears. (Note to self: add gear ratio to\r\nworkout notes.)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> But more than anything, I'm going to make sure I get <em>two</em>\r\ninterval workouts each week, and I'm going to get back to regularly\r\nmeasuring my performance on Bulldog.  Consistent effort, continuous\r\nfeedback.\r\n</p>\r\n"

    "intro": "<p> I think it's a mistake to focus too tightly on Lance Armstrong.\r\nCycling's doping addiction runs deep, and Armstrong is just the face\r\nof that problem.  My personal take: for those willing to\r\ndope, <em>not</em> doping looks like a one-way ticket home.  The\r\nlikelihood of getting caught is low, and the rewards are immense.  If\r\nwe're going to have a clean peloton, stiffer penalties aren't going to\r\nget it done.  We need effective testing to improve the likelihood of\r\ncatching dopers.  We need the USADA and UCI to <em>win</em> the doping\r\narms race.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> So.  That's my take-away on doping.  On to Lance Armstrong.\r\n</p>\r\n",
    "body": "<p> Asked if he found joy in winning, he said he found more joy in the\r\npreparation.  That resonates with my own motivations, and echos what\r\nI've heard from so many accomplished people.  It's less about winning,\r\nand more about the <em>doing</em>.  Learning new stuff has helped my\r\ncareer, but that's not why I learned it.  I learned it because I enjoy\r\nlearning.  I think that to really achieve in any field, you have to enjoy\r\nthe <em>day-to-day reality of the doing</em>.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Armstrong was also asked why his experience with cancer didn't\r\nmake him wary of the health problems associated with\r\ndoping.  <a href=\"http://www.fatcyclist.com/2013/01/17/hey-lets-watch-some-oprah-together-tonight/\">Fat\r\nCyclist</a> noted that after immersion in the \"deeply medical world of\r\ncancer\", it's common to be <em>less</em> drug-averse.  I can only\r\nimagine that if Armstrong stuck to his \"cocktail\" of EPO,\r\ntestosterone, and blood transfusions, all under the oversight of\r\nDr. Ferrari, it must have <em>felt</em> extremely safe.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Armstrong several times used\r\nthe language of addiction and recovery to talk about this.  I kind of\r\nthink that he's still <em>saying</em> \"I was wrong\", but the unspoken\r\nend of that sentence is, \"...but I'm still not sure <em>why</em>.\"  I\r\nstill got the impression that he's still thinking in terms of how all\r\nthis affects <em>him</em>.  He said he didn't think this would be that\r\nbig a deal, that nobody would care this much, which suggests he's\r\nstill getting his head around how this actually hurt anyone.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> The answer is: stories are powerful.  The story Armstrong told, the\r\nlie, was powerful enough to build LiveStrong.  When the story turns out to be a lie,\r\nyou've destroyed the founding myth of a movement.  Sometimes, when\r\nyou're facing a challenge, you just need a <em>reason</em>, and for so\r\nmany, for so long, Lance Armstrong's story was that reason.  A reason\r\nto believe they could win.  A reason to believe they would one day be\r\nstronger.  A reason to help.  A reason to fight.  A reason to keep\r\ngoing.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> And now a lot of people need to go find a new reason.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Here's the thing: If I'm ever diagnosed with cancer, I'm calling\r\nLiveStrong before I even leave my doctor's office.  And if I can, I'm\r\ncalling the man himself.  Because I <em>love</em> the idea that he not\r\nonly beat stage III cancer, he then went on to be a total bastard.\r\nThere's a vitality in <em>that</em> story that I <em>still</em> find\r\ndeeply inspiring.  And I might need a little bit of that one day.\r\n</p>\r\n"

On Mondays,\r\n  I do a hill climbing interval workout, and on Thursday or Friday I\r\n  do a longer hill climb of about 20 minutes or so.  And in between\r\n  I'd do easy recovery rides to keep the legs limber and burn a few\r\n  calories.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> The <a href=\"http://dreadedmonkeygod.net/home/archive/2780\">data</a>\r\n  for last few weeks indicated a three-day recovery cycle after each\r\n  interval workout, and called into question the value of the longer\r\n  (20-minute) hill climbs I've been doing.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> So I tried something new: I switched my second workout this week\r\n  from a hill climb to an inverval session. Today's invervals\r\n  demonstrated a 3% performance improvement over Monday.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> This tells me I was right about the three-day recovery cycle.  And\r\n  it tells me I was right about the longer hill climbs: they're not\r\n  helping to improve my interval performance.  \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> And it tells me that by doing a second interval workout each week\r\n  instead of a hill climb, I might greatly increase the pace at which\r\n  I'm getting stronger.  Nice.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> The literature says that building strength helps endurance.  So\r\n  the intervals <em>should</em> be helping the climbs.  So I'm going\r\n  to test the hypothesis by doing two interval workouts each week for\r\n  the next three weeks, and then testing my performance on the\r\n  Westlake Blvd. climb.  If my theory is right, I should set a new PR\r\n  on the climb.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> To be continued...\r\n</p>\r\n",

Later, I'd learn how to do that.\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p> I experienced something similar climbing Johnson Fire Rd. the\r\nother night.  I found myself pushing harder than before, and expecting\r\nto implode, but I simply didn't.

Only about 41% of that money came from car-specific taxes and fees.  The rest, about 59%, came from local governments' general funds, county sales\r\ntaxes, and other local funds, which <em>everyone</em> pays into, whether they drive or not.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> There's also some debate about the cost of bike lanes and\r\nbike-centric road improvements, and whether it's justified.  Total\r\nspending statewide on bike lanes: $14 <em>million</em>, or 0.0017% of\r\ntotal transportation spending.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> According to\r\nthe <a href=\"http://www.vtpi.org/whoserd.pdf\">Victoria Transportation\r\nPolicy Institue</a>, bicycles impose only 0.2¢ in roadway costs for\r\nevery mile they travel. (Cars cost the state 5.6¢ per mile.)\r\nAt <a href=\"http://app.strava.com/athletes/542024\">2000 miles per\r\nyear</a>, the sales tax on <em>just one</em> of my bikes should pay\r\nfor the next <em>20 years</em> of wear and tear on my local roads.\r\n</p>",

    "body": "<p><strong>Iron and the Soul &#8211; By Henry Rollins</strong></p>\r\n<p><em>I believe that the definition of definition is reinvention. To not be like your parents. To not be like your friends. To be yourself.</em></p>\r\n<p>Completely.</p>\r\n<p>When I was young I had no sense of myself. All I was, was a product of all the fear and humiliation I suffered. Fear of my parents. The humiliation of teachers calling me &#8220;garbage can&#8221; and telling me I&#8217;d be mowing lawns for a living. And the very real terror of my fellow students. I was threatened and beaten up for the color of my skin and my size. I was skinny and clumsy, and when others would tease me I didn&#8217;t run home crying, wondering why. I knew all too well. I was there to be antagonized. In sports I was laughed at. A spaz. I was pretty good at boxing but only because the rage that filled my every waking moment made me wild and unpredictable. I fought with some strange fury. The other boys thought I was crazy.</p>\r\n<p>I hated myself all the time. As stupid at it seems now, I wanted to talk like them, dress like them, carry myself with the ease of knowing that I wasn&#8217;t going to get pounded in the hallway between classes. Years passed and I learned to keep it all inside. I only talked to a few boys in my grade. Other losers. Some of them are to this day the greatest people I have ever known. Hang out with a guy who has had his head flushed down a toilet a few times, treat him with respect, and you&#8217;ll find a faithful friend forever. But even with friends, school sucked. Teachers gave me hard time. I didn&#8217;t think much of them either.</p>\r\n<p>Then came Mr. Pepperman, my advisor. He was a powerfully built Vietnam veteran, and he was scary. No one ever talked out of turn in his class. Once one kid did and Mr. P. lifted him off the ground and pinned him to the blackboard. Mr. P. could see that I was in bad shape, and one Friday in October he asked me if I had ever worked out with weights. I told him no. He told me that I was going to take some of the money that I had saved and buy a hundred-pound set of weights at Sears. As I left his office, I started to think of things I would say to him on Monday when he asked about the weights that I was not going to buy. Still, it made me feel special. My father never really got that close to caring. On Saturday I bought the weights, but I couldn&#8217;t even drag them to my mom&#8217;s car. An attendant laughed at me as he put them on a dolly.</p>\r\n<p>Monday came and I was called into Mr. P.&#8217;s office after school. He said that he was going to show me how to work out. He was going to put me on a program and start hitting me in the solar plexus in the hallway when I wasn&#8217;t looking. When I could take the punch we would know that we were getting somewhere. At no time was I to look at myself in the mirror or tell anyone at school what I was doing. In the gym he showed me ten basic exercises. I paid more attention than I ever did in any of my classes. I didn&#8217;t want to blow it. I went home that night and started right in.</p>\r\n<p>Weeks passed, and every once in a while Mr. P. would give me a shot and drop me in the hallway, sending my books flying. The other students didn&#8217;t know what to think. More weeks passed, and I was steadily adding new weights to the bar. I could sense the power inside my body growing. I could feel it.</p>\r\n<p>Right before Christmas break I was walking to class, and from out of nowhere Mr. Pepperman appeared and gave me a shot in the chest. I laughed and kept going. He said I could look at myself now. I got home and ran to the bathroom and pulled off my shirt. I saw a body, not just the shell that housed my stomach and my heart. My biceps bulged. My chest had definition. I felt strong. It was the first time I can remember having a sense of myself. I had done something and no one could ever take it away. You couldn&#8217;t say shit to me.</p>\r\n<p>It took me years to fully appreciate the value of the lessons I have learned from the Iron. I used to think that it was my adversary, that I was trying to lift that which does not want to be lifted. I was wrong. When the Iron doesn&#8217;t want to come off the mat, it&#8217;s the kindest thing it can do for you. If it flew up and went through the ceiling, it wouldn&#8217;t teach you anything. That&#8217;s the way the Iron talks to you. It tells you that the material you work with is that which you will come to resemble. That which you work against will always work against you.</p>\r\n<p>It wasn&#8217;t until my late twenties that I learned that by working out I had given myself a great gift. I learned that nothing good comes without work and a certain amount of pain. When I finish a set that leaves me shaking, I know more about myself. When something gets bad, I know it can&#8217;t be as bad as that workout.</p>\r\n<p>I used to fight the pain, but recently this became clear to me: pain is not my enemy; it is my call to greatness. But when dealing with the Iron, one must be careful to interpret the pain correctly. Most injuries involving the Iron come from ego. I once spent a few weeks lifting weight that my body wasn&#8217;t ready for and spent a few months not picking up anything heavier than a fork. Try to lift what you&#8217;re not prepared to and the Iron will teach you a little lesson in restraint and self-control.</p>\r\n<p>I have never met a truly strong person who didn&#8217;t have self-respect. I think a lot of inwardly and outwardly directed contempt passes itself off as self-respect: the idea of raising yourself by stepping on someone&#8217;s shoulders instead of doing it yourself. When I see guys working out for cosmetic reasons, I see vanity exposing them in the worst way, as cartoon characters, billboards for imbalance and insecurity. Strength reveals itself through character. It is the difference between bouncers who get off strong-arming people and Mr. Pepperman.</p>\r\n<p>Muscle mass does not always equal strength. Strength is kindness and sensitivity. Strength is understanding that your power is both physical and emotional. That it comes from the body and the mind. And the heart.</p>\r\n<p>Yukio Mishima said that he could not entertain the idea of romance if he was not strong. Romance is such a strong and overwhelming passion, a weakened body cannot sustain it for long. I have some of my most romantic thoughts when I am with the Iron. Once I was in love with a woman. I thought about her the most when the pain from a workout was racing through my body.</p>\r\n<p>Everything in me wanted her. So much so that sex was only a fraction of my total desire. It was the single most intense love I have ever felt, but she lived far away and I didn&#8217;t see her very often. Working out was a healthy way of dealing with the loneliness. To this day, when I work out I usually listen to ballads.</p>\r\n<p>I prefer to work out alone. It enables me to concentrate on the lessons that the Iron has for me. Learning about what you&#8217;re made of is always time well spent, and I have found no better teacher. The Iron had taught me how to live. Life is capable of driving you out of your mind. The way it all comes down these days, it&#8217;s some kind of miracle if you&#8217;re not insane. People have become separated from their bodies. They are no longer whole.</p>\r\n<p>I see them move from their offices to their cars and on to their suburban homes. They stress out constantly, they lose sleep, they eat badly. And they behave badly. Their egos run wild; they become motivated by that which will eventually give them a massive stroke. They need the Iron Mind.</p>\r\n<p>Through the years, I have combined meditation, action, and the Iron into a single strength. I believe that when the body is strong, the mind thinks strong thoughts. Time spent away from the Iron makes my mind degenerate. I wallow in a thick depression. My body shuts down my mind.</p>\r\n<p>The Iron is the best antidepressant I have ever found. There is no better way to fight weakness than with strength. Once the mind and body have been awakened to their true potential, it&#8217;s impossible to turn back.</p>\r\n<p>The Iron never lies to you. You can walk outside and listen to all kinds of talk, get told that you&#8217;re a god or a total bastard. The Iron will always kick you the real deal. The Iron is the great reference point, the all-knowing perspective giver. Always there like a beacon in the pitch black. I have found the Iron to be my greatest friend. It never freaks out on me, never runs. Friends may come and go. But two hundred pounds is always two hundred pounds.</p>"

    "body": "<p> <b>To-Do Lists</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I use an iPhone app\r\ncalled <a href=\"http://culturedcode.com/things/\">Things</a> to manage\r\nmy to-do lists.  I started out doing\r\nfull-on <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Getting-Things-Done-Stress-Free-Productivity/dp/0142000280/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1350926790&sr=8-1&keywords=getting+things+done\">Getting Things Done</a>, but I've gradually simplified.  Nowadays,\r\nI just keep a few lists: Errands, Home, Groceries, and Home Depot.\r\nWhen I notice I'm getting low on milk, I put \"milk\" on the Groceries\r\nlist.  When I put a hole in my work gloves, I put \"gloves\" on the Home\r\nDepot list.  \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <i>Things</i> also has a nifty scheduling feature that lets you\r\nmark tasks to be done on a certain day, or set them to repeat.  I have\r\na repeating weekly task to back up my laptop.  Every three weeks I put\r\nin a new set of contacts.  Once a month my dogs get a Frontline\r\ntreatment.  And every three months, I get a reminder to buy more\r\nFrontline.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Now, here's the thing: stuff goes on the list if:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li> It's important that I do it.\r\n  <li> I might forget to do it.\r\n  <li> It has to be done on/by a certain date.\r\n  <li> I don't want to think about it until it's due.\r\n  <li> I want a record that I did it, and when.    \r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p> And it's tough to talk about this stuff without talking about\r\npriorities.  I'll leave the in-depth discussion for another time.  For\r\nnow, it suffices to make two points:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> First: anything on the bottom two levels\r\nof <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow's_hierarchy_of_needs\">Maslow's\r\nHierarchy</a> (biological needs &amp; physical safety) implicitly\r\ntrumps everything else.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Second: I suffer <em>zero</em> guilt if I reach the end of my day\r\nwith items left to be done.  I either move them to a day I plan to do\r\nthem, or I shrug and cross them off.  I enjoy what I did accomplish\r\nrather than lament what I did not.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Calendar</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I use <a href=\"http://calendar.google.com\">Google Calendar</a>.\r\nIt's accessible anywhere, and just about every calendar tool syncs\r\nwith it.  Appointements, vacations, training plans, birthday parties,\r\nanything that has a date associated with it goes on the calendar.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I distinguish between scheduled items on my to-do list and\r\ncalendar events thus: <em>tasks</em> go on my to-do\r\nlist, <em>events</em> go on my calendar.  So: \"Turn in vacation\r\nrequest form\" goes on my to-do list.  \"Vacation in Tahiti\" goes on my\r\ncalendar.  Yes, this is fuzzy.  It works for me.  \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Filing Cabinet</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I can put my finger on any important piece of paper in under two\r\nminutes.  Birth certificate, passport, warrantee paperwork for the hot\r\nwater heater, instruction manuals, whatever.  It's in the file\r\ncabinet.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Wiki</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I have a\r\npersonal <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki\">wiki</a>, and\r\nit's a <em>fantastic</em> tool.  It holds:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li> my dogs' vaccination records\r\n  <li> information and upgrade records for my bikes\r\n  <li> house-related info (paint colors for various rooms, contact\r\ninfo for plumbers &amp; electricians, etc.)\r\n  <li> vacation plans\r\n  <li> notes I take while reading books\r\n  <li> links to take-out menus for local restaurants\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>This Blog</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I can't tell you how often I've referred to this blog when filling\r\nout loan applications, lease agreements, and other official paperwork.\r\nWhen I'm picking new tires for my bike, it's handy to know how long\r\nthe current ones lasted.  And having a searchable record of my bike\r\nrides and runs is invaluable in planning future rides.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>iPhone</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I have the contact info for just about everyone I've ever called.\r\nThis includes restaurants and businesses.  This means that my list of\r\n\"recent calls\" is human-readable, rather than just a list of numbers.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Reservations and take-out orders are a snap: I search for the name\r\nof the restaurant using Spotlight, then call and order.  No Googling,\r\nno digging through drawers for take-out menus.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> And my phone holds my to-do list.  That way, wherever I am, I can\r\nalways pull out my phone, check/add to my list, and get back to\r\nwhatever I'm doing.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> And it makes it possible to handle small errands or organizational\r\nstuff from anywhere.  Having a smartphone makes my life easier.\r\n</p>"

I'm chalking this up to fueling well during the\r\nride.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> So, since I'm feeling so good, I wanted to push myself a little\r\nbit on my lunch ride today.

    "intro": "<p> <a href=\"archive/2750\">Yesterday's ride</a> didn't go as planned.\r\nAnd I'd put a lot of energy into planning.  I\r\ntimed <a href=\"http://dreadedmonkeygod.net/home/archive/2741\">my last\r\nbig ride</a> so that I'd be fully recovered for this.  I pre-rode most\r\nof the route, and tried out different fuels.  I picked a day when\r\nJanell would be out of town, and a parking spot that would give me\r\noptions.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> And, after all that, I had to bail after just 17 miles due to\r\nfatigue and cramping.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Disaster?  Anything but.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> The only way you learn is by trying.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I put all the same planning into this that I would for a supported\r\nride.  This flushed out supply chain problems. I ordered a box of\r\nHoney Stinger Waffles from Amazon, and selected the \"3-5 Business\r\nDays\" shipping option.  Unfortunately, the waffles didn't ship right\r\naway, and haven't arrived.  Ditto for a box of Gu.  So, now I know:\r\norder supplies a month ahead.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I also forgot to start my GPS until I was a few minutes from the\r\nstart.  If I were pacing myself, or working from a set of planned\r\nsplits, this would be a problem.  So now I can start thinking about\r\nhow to deal with that situation.  (I know there's an \"auto-start\"\r\nfeature of my GPS unit.  Might be worth enabling.)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I tested my fuel routine on smaller rides, and know it's solid.\r\nSo I couldn't blame fuel for my fatigue.  I really looked at the data,\r\nwhich (ironically?) illuminated how much stronger I am on a bike these\r\ndays.  And it told me that my legs take too long to recharge between\r\nshort climbs.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> And if I hadn't planned a big ride and pushed as hard as I did, I\r\nnever would have known that avoiding cramps might be something I need\r\nto work on.  I'm not happy that it happened, but I'm <em>very</em>\r\nhappy that it happened on a just-for-fun ride instead of something\r\nbigger that I'd invested real time and money and travel in.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> And I got to go play for as long as I was able on some of the best\r\ntrails anywhere.  Not a bad way to spend a morning.\r\n</p>\r\n",

    "intro": "<p> I had <a href=\"archive/2749\">planned</a> this ride as a way to get\r\nmy head around doing something at the scale of\r\nthe <a href=\"http://www.leadvilleraceseries.com/page/show/315773-leadville-trail-100-mtb\">Leadville\r\n100</a>.  I'd do 45 miles, and see what went well and what didn't.\r\nI'd find out how my legs did, see whether my fuel worked well, all\r\nthat stuff.  Some things you just don't know until you push yourself\r\nand see what happens.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Here's what happened: I parked my car at the Encinal Cyn\r\ntrailhead, and rode east on the Backbone trail to Castro Mtwy.  Then I\r\ndescended Bulldog, took a short break, and then started climbing\r\nback <em>up</em> Bulldog.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Then: I got tired, which made me consider bailing, and then my\r\nquads and hamstrings started cramping.  That made the decision easy.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> At first, I was a little mystified as to why I was so tired.  I've\r\ndone rides that\r\nwere <a href=\"http://app.strava.com/activities/11170603\">equally\r\nstrenuous</a>.  Then I looked at the numbers.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> The ride from '09 had its climbing spaced out into three major\r\nclimbs.  On today's ride, I felt like I was <em>always</em> climbing,\r\nand the profile backs this up: lots of short(ish) climbs, followed by\r\nshort descents.  There was never a chance to fully reset and get my\r\nlegs back.  I think I've gotten very used to Rocky Peak style riding:\r\nlong climbs, long descents.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> But it's the <em>pace</em> information that tells the story, I\r\nthink.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Back in '09, at the 2:30 mark, I'd covered 13.6 miles and climbed\r\n1700 ft.  At the 2:30 mark of today's ride, I'd covered 11 miles, and\r\nclimbed 3300 ft.  That's 80% of the distance, and nearly double the\r\nclimbing.  Today, I was <em>killing</em> my pace from '09.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> So, that in a nutshell is why this ride kicked my ass.  I set out\r\nto learn, and learn I did.  \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Now the challenge is: How do I apply what I learned today?\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n",
    "body": "<p> <b>Gear Notes</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Fuel:</b> My fueling strategy worked really well.  My legs are\r\ncooked, but not horrible, and I haven't had any kind of gnarly\r\npost-ride energy crash like I used to.  I ate about 4 waffles while on\r\nthe ride, and this might be necessary for longer rides, but today it\r\nfelt like Gu was better at keeping me going.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Brakes:</b> So, so done with these.

[...] You have to figure out what's important to\r\n    you and what motivates you; ask yourself why that stuff isn't gnawing\r\n    at you enough to make you get it done. Fix that.\r\n  </p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p> Wozniack:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n  But if you're already a pretty organised person with a good feeling of\r\n  what's important and why, then you don't need a to-do list.\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p> Logic like this makes me want to throw things and use foul language\r\n  and rant and rail.  \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n",

I think that if you're going to\r\n  be a grown-up about managing your time, you have to make peace with\r\n  the fact that there are only so many hours in the day.  Any guilt\r\n  about the tasks you didn't have time for is <em>entirely</em>\r\n  self-inflicted.  Either do those things tomorrow, or forget about\r\n  them and enjoy what you <em>did</em> accomplish.  You can see how\r\n  important something is to you by looking at all the things you gave\r\n  up to achieve it.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> And having a list lets me <em>balance</em> priorities.  It lets me\r\n  relax while I'm standing in line at the post office, because I know\r\n  that I've blocked off two hours <em>tomorrow</em> to go ride my\r\n  bike.  It lets me really enjoy my bike ride because I know that\r\n  everything else I need to do is on schedule.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Having a list lets me manage my life and my time.  If I see that\r\n  I'm going to be swamped <em>next</em> week, I make sure to burn out my legs\r\n  <em>this</em> week.  That way, instead of being frustrated that I'm\r\n  too swamped to ride, I'm happy to have a rest week.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> In short, keeping to-do lists is just a means to an end.  If it\r\n  doesn't achieve the ends you want, then don't do it.  But it's not the\r\n  list's fault.\r\n</p>\r\n"

I\r\nsaid that after every ride I see a couple of little wet spots on the\r\ntire where the sealant has done its work.  \"Those are all the flats\r\nI <em>did not get</em>,\" I laughed.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Laughed, like a fool.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Yesterday evening, I noticed a goat head stuck in my rear tire.  I\r\npulled it out and heard the familiar hiss of air escaping.  <i>No problem,</i> I thought.  <i>That'll seal itself in no\r\ntime.</i>  I gave the tire a spin.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> The tire did not seal itself.  There was no more sealant in the\r\ntire.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Consider: the thorn was in my tire for <em>three days</em> before\r\nI pulled it out.  The flat was <em>already waiting to happen</em> when\r\nI jynxed myself.  It's like it <em>knew</em>.  And a goathead leaves\r\njust a tiny little pinhole.  So there really had to be next to no\r\nsealant left for this to happen.  \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> And I didn't just, y'know, discover that my tire was going flat on\r\na ride.  I <em>pulled the thorn myself</em>.  \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> It's this kind of stuff that makes me believe in fate.  \r\n</p>\r\n",

So, I'm thinking hill repeats, running, or some\r\nkind of Tabata workout.

I have two main, quantifiable goals:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n  <li> I want to improve my average speed, and climbing speed. (I'll\r\n  use <a href=\"archive/2704\">Bulldog</a> as my climbing benchmark, and\r\n  a loop in Cheeseboro for my average speed benchmark.)\r\n  <li> I want to be able to periodically produce a short (2 min) high\r\n  intensity kick, then return to long-haul pedaling.\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p> The first is a function of strength.  Muscles reach their maximum\r\noxygen consumption at about 30% of their maximum force output.  So\r\nincreasing strength will reduce the amount of oxygen I burn while\r\npedaling.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> The second is driven by metabolism.  I need to train my body to\r\nqucikly recover from short, intense efforts.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> So my reps will target strength, while my set structure will mimic\r\nthe metabolic demands of mountain biking.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n  <li> 3 circuits:\r\n\t<ol>\r\n\t  <li> squat: 5 @ 90% 1RM\r\n\t  <li> leg press: 90 seconds @ 50%\r\n\t  <li> 2 min rest\r\n\t</ol>\r\n  </li>\r\n  <li> 3 circuits:\r\n\t<ol>\r\n\t  <li> bench: 5 @ 90% 1RM\r\n\t  <li> Swiss ball push-ups: 90 seconds @ 50%\r\n\t  <li> 2 min rest\r\n\t</ol>\r\n  </li>\r\n  <li> deadlift: 2x5 @ 80%, 2 min rest </li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p> The idea is to target strength with the main work sets, then\r\ndeplete energy stores with the supersets, forcing my body to spend the\r\n2 min. <em>between</em> sets replenishing available energy.  And I've\r\nmixed some instability into the supersets for better specificity.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> All in all, I think that's pretty good.  Basic, but solid.  I'm\r\nhoping to get started next week and see where this takes me.\r\n</p>\r\n",

    "body": "\r\n<p> I like this book for a couple of reasons.  It\r\ndiscusses <em>all</em> training goals, not simply strength and size.\r\nAnd it presents the mechanics of strength training in clear,\r\nscientific terms.  A trainee isn't a novice because they're weak or\r\nunskilled, they're a novice because a single workout is enough to\r\ncause adaptation <em>before the next workout</em>.  And an\r\nintermediate trainee is \"intermediate\" because a workout big enough to\r\ncause adaptation is <em>too</em> big to recover from before the next\r\nworkout.  (Yes, you <em>could</em> just allow more time between\r\nworkouts.  But trying to schedule a workout every 5 days is tricky,\r\ny'know?)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> And reading it has shed <em>lots</em> of light on recent bike\r\nrides.  I'm increasingly sure that I've transitioned into the\r\n\"intermediate\" stage of bike training.  (I think I hit this phase a\r\nfew years back, but lost a lot of strength during the year I didn't\r\nhave a mountain bike.)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> In a nutshell: several bike rides in the recent past have left me\r\ntired, but I recovered from them quickly, and did not get stronger or\r\nfaster.  I execute better on a given trail, but I'm\r\ngaining <em>skill</em>, rather than <em>strength</em>.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> And finally, last week, I <a href=\"archive/2704\">cranked up\r\nBulldog</a>, producing an extended (45-min) effort at high intensity.\r\nI was decidedly <em>not</em> recovered by Sunday, when I went for a\r\nride\r\nin <a href=\"http://dreadedmonkeygod.net/home/archive/2705\">Cheeseboro</a>.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> In short, I've hit the point that a ride tough enough to make me\r\nstronger is <em>too</em> tough to recover from in less than five or\r\nsix days.  Pretty much the definition of \"intermediate.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> So.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Now that I fully have my head around that, I recognize that if I\r\nwant to get stronger, I've got to do bigger rides, (even if they're\r\nshorter in duration) and then give my body time to recover.  I can\r\nsimply rest, or I can go on light- or medium-intensity rides, but\r\npushing too hard is just going to lead to a never-ending treadmill of\r\nfatigue.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I don't intend to go crazy and start structuring my rides for\r\nmaximal strength/speed gains.  But I <em>do</em> need to listen to my\r\nbody more.  I'll listen more closely to my body after big rides, and\r\nrespect that there'll be more of an ebb and flow to my energy.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Now, I <em>could</em> just relax and enjoy riding and be happy and\r\nnot worry about trying to go faster, or climb higher, or ride farther.\r\nBut that's just not an option I take very seriously.  \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> After all, tinkering with my body is part of the fun.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> And I'll be starting in the weight room soon.  Should be\r\ninteresting.\r\n</p>\r\n"

    "intro": "<blockquote>\r\n  <p> A cyclist's knee is never flexed beyond 90 degrees, so if specificity\r\n\tis considered only in terms of knee flexion, the conclusion would be\r\n\tthat squatting above parallel is specific to cycling performance, and\r\n\tthat full squats are not. This, in fact, is what many coaches and\r\n\ttrainers believe and advise their athletes to do, in more sports than\r\n\tcycling. This is misguided. The problem here is a misunderstanding of\r\n\tthe exercise and its relationship to the sport skill: a partial squat\r\n\tdoes not produce a strong hamstring contraction. Any cyclist who does\r\n\tpartial squats is not developing balanced strength around the knee and\r\n\tis neglecting the muscles used in the hip-extension aspect of a\r\n\tproperly executed pedaling cycle. In cycling jargon, the trainee will\r\n\tbe developing only the ability to \"pedal in squares,\" the mark of a\r\n\tbeginner and of mechanical inefficiency, when she should be developing\r\n\tthe ability to pedal in circles, the mark of a skillful, strong\r\n\trider. So although the partial squat may superficially look more\r\n\tspecific, in anatomical action and in the quality of muscular function\r\n\tand development the more generalized full squat is more applicable to\r\n\tthe activity. The addition of leg curls to the program is not the\r\n\tanswer; correct analysis of the squat is.\r\n  </p>\r\n\r\n  <span class=\"attribution\">- <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Practical-Programming-Strength-Training-Rippetoe/dp/0982522703/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1343159980&sr=8-1\">Rippetoe &amp; Kilgore</a></span>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n",

    "intro": "<p> I've wanted to have some kind of \"thumnail map\" feature for a\r\nwhile.  I want images to use for rides where I\r\nwas <a href=\"archive/2597\">too busy riding</a> to stop for a photo, or\r\nto use for map icons, etc.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I noticed that <a href=\"http://strava.com\">Strava</a> uses\r\nthe <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/staticmaps/\">Google\r\nStatic Maps API</a> to create thumbnail images of ride routes.\r\nBasically, you build a URL for an image, and the URL has the GPS track\r\ninfo included as a parameter.  Google then builds a jpg showing the\r\nGPS track overlayed on a map.  Perfect!\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Unfortunately, the whole GPS track has to be specified in the URL\r\nusing latitude and longitude.  And the entire URL has to be shorter\r\nthan 2048 characters.  That sounds like a lot, but it isn't.  So I\r\nstarted looking for ways to cram more data into that URL.\r\n</p>\r\n",
    "body": "<p> I looked at the URLs that Strava uses for their images, and\r\nspotted a couple of super-simple improvements I could make.  First,\r\nthey reduced latitude and longitude coordinates to four decimal\r\nplaces, which makes them\r\n <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal_degrees\">accurate to\r\nwithin about 10 meters</a>, which is fine for a postcard-sized map.\r\nThen they removed trailing zeros, which reduces the character count\r\nwithout reducing precision.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> But even after doing both of those things, there is only enough\r\nspace in the URL for for about 80 points.  (Some other stuff has to go\r\nin the URL too.)  Unfortunately, a typical record of a ride contains\r\nseveral <em>thousand</em>points.  So I need some way of boiling down\r\nall that data to just what's needed for a thumbnail.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I've been using my own algorithm for simplifying GPS tracks for a\r\nlong time.  But about the best it could do was to reduce the number of\r\ntrackpoints by ~60%.  That's fine for full-size map pages, but totally\r\ninadequate for the task of reducing a 3000-point track to an 80-point\r\nthumbnail.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> A bit of googling led me to\r\na <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4480434/simplification-optimization-of-gps-track\">post\r\non Stack Overflow</a> which mentioned\r\nthe <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramer%E2%80%93Douglas%E2%80%93Peucker_algorithm\">Ramer-Douglas-Peucker\r\nalgorithm</a> for line simplification.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> The idea is pretty simple.  Let's say you want the N most\r\n\"interesting\" points from a given GPS track.  You start with the first\r\npoint on the track (A), and the last (Z).  Then you scan along the\r\nwhole track looking for the point that's farthest from line AZ.  Let's\r\ncall that point R.  Then you repeat the process for the points between\r\nA and R, and betwene R and Z, each time adding the most interesting\r\npoint to your output, until you have identified the N most\r\n\"interesting\" points.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> This is pretty great.  It gives me a way to generate 80-point\r\ntracks that reasonably represent the original data.  <em>And</em> it\r\ngives me a way to arbitrarily determine how fine I want the resolution\r\non any track to be based on how much information I want.  With this\r\nmethod, and with the improvements in formatting above, I know that\r\nevery trackpoint will be represented in no more than 20 characters\r\n(including delimiters).  So, given either a character limit, or a\r\nlimit on the number of trackpoints, I can simplify <em>any</em> GPS\r\ntrack to meet my needs.  Awesome.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> The new \"thinning\" algorithm (AKA \"pruning\" or \"compression\" or\r\n\"simplification\") is now used for both map pages and thumbnails, and\r\nseems to be working pretty well.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> So what's next?\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> While retrieving the X most \"interesting\" points works really well\r\nfor thumbnails, I'm seeing that it's not the best for the full-sized\r\nmaps.  So I'll be tweaking the implementation a little to handle cases\r\nwhere I care more about fidelity than compression.  Rather than place\r\na hard limit on the number of points, I'll tweak the algorithm to stop\r\nwhen the simplified track doesn't deviate more than 5m from the\r\noriginal.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Anyway, I'm sure that I'm the only one who really cares about the\r\ninternals of the mapping improvements, but I wanted to write this up\r\nbecause it's been such a great example of how adding a small\r\nimprovement can lead to some really interesting stuff, which is why I\r\nbuild my own software in the first place.  There are plenty of\r\nutilities out there that will simplify gps tracks for me, but I learn\r\na lot, and have a lot of fun doing it myself.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n"

    "intro": "<p> The <a href=\"http://tourdivide.org\">Tour Divide</a> is a mountain bike race from Banff, Alberta to Antelope Wells, New Mexico along the Continental Divide.  There are various rules, but the gist is: <i>You are on your own.</i>  There is no ambulance.  There is no rescue crew.  There are no support stations or volunteers or check-in points to make sure you're not dead.  Riders at the front of the pack average more than 170 miles each day, in brutal conditions from freezing rain to bone-dry heat.  Most who start the race do not finish.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> If this race were covered as well as the Tour de France, I'd spend the next month glued to the screen.  It's in the true spirit of exploration and self-reliance that we North Americans like to think our country was built on.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> The race starts today at noon, in Banff.  Competitors are carrying GPS units, and can be tracked <a href=\"http://trackleaders.com/tourdivide\">here</a>.\r\n</p>",

So I planned out a\r\nroute that incorporated some favorite trails, and lots of new stuff.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Just about everything was new in some way.  I'd only ever ridden\r\nthe Lynnmere Trail eastward.  And I'd never ridden the western half of\r\nthe Lynnmere Trail at all.  And after descending Shooting Star last\r\nweek, I really wanted to climb it.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> And this time I remembered to do the really new\r\nstuff <em>first</em>.  The western half of the Lynnmere Trail really\r\nisn't built for bikes.  Lots of stairs. (Which men (and women) more\r\nmacho than me do ride, I'm sure.).  \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> But the real kicker is that, as far as I can tell, the western end\r\nof Lynnmere doesn't connect to anything.  It just fades out into\r\nunmaintained rabbit trails just above the water treatment plant.  I\r\ndescended a set of switchbacks to reach the arroyo, but had to explore\r\na little to find a spot to cross.  So yeah.  The southwest corner of\r\nthe map needs revision.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Aside from that, it was a great ride.  My legs are cooked, and I'm\r\nlooking forward to an easy recovery spin at lunch tomorrow.\r\n</p>\r\n",

They drift out of bike lanes.  They\r\nignore stop signs and red lights.  They ride side-by-side and clog up\r\ntraffic lanes.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Drivers aren't much better.  We (myself included) talk on our\r\nmobile phones.  We text.  We play with the radio.  We roll through\r\nstop signs.  We speed.  (And sometimes we mix and match these\r\nviolations.)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Blaming each other won't make anyone safer.  We have to remember that\r\nnobody's perfect.  All of us, cyclists and motorists alike, are doing\r\nthe best we can.  We juggle families and jobs and bills.  We're all\r\njust trying to get through the day with our health and our dignity\r\nintact.

But she says something that exposes a common\r\nblind spot, I think:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\nRegular exercise requires a careful mental shift. First you clearly\r\nprioritize what's important to you, and why. Then you pick a specific\r\ntime and specific place, and then you convince yourself that going is\r\nnot negotiable.\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p> I exercise regularly enough that I'm stronger than I've ever been\r\non a mountain bike.  I have two bikes, two pairs of running shoes, and\r\nthere's a shower at work where I can clean up after a lunchtime ride\r\nor run.  Fitting a workout into my schedule is easy.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> But trying to schedule an appointment to check out a local\r\nCrossFit gym was a disaster.  I rescheduled three times, and finally\r\ngave up and told the owner I'd stop by if and when I had a chance.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Why?  Because trying to \"pick a specific time and specific place\"\r\nis really, really hard for me.  And, I think, for a lot of people.\r\nStuff happens.  Kids get sick.  Dogs get sick.  You realize have to\r\nget a Mother's Day gift.  And so you simply don't <em>have</em> 45\r\nminutes to exercise.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I contend that this is <em>totally okay.</em>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I almost <em>never</em> schedule a workout for a specific place\r\nand time.  Instead, I weigh the weather, my to-do list, my energy\r\nlevel, and how long it's been since my last workout, and I pack for\r\nthe workout I <em>want</em> to do that day.  If the stars align, I get\r\nto go ride my mountain bike after work.  Or I go for a run or lift\r\nweights on my lunch hour.  I do what I have the <em>opportunity</em>\r\nto do.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> If I want to ride my bike on my lunch hour, but it might rain\r\n(biking in the rain is dangerous and miserable), I also pack clothes\r\nto go running in the rain (<em>running</em> in the rain is serene and\r\nrefreshing).  I pack a gym back nearly <em>every day</em>.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> The trickiest scenario is when I realize I won't get to\r\nexercise <em>tomorrow</em>.  By the time I know this, it's usually too\r\nlate to late to pack a gym bag for <em>today</em>.  Having the gym bag\r\nalways packed means I have some options in this case.  I can do a\r\nworkout at lunch or after work.  I just worked out yesterday, and I'm\r\ntired?  No problem.  I go easy.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> The key here is that I'm ready for whatever will fit into my day,\r\nor my week.

We saw a few spots\r\nwhere the gophers pulled the grass down <em>through</em> the mesh, but\r\nafter a day or two the gophers gave up and went elsewhere.  Peace\r\nreturned to the yard.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> With the mesh in place, the worst we've seen is a golf ball-sized\r\nhole in the sod, with no gopher mound, and no crater.  The mesh stops\r\nthe cycle of violence, so to speak.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> But pushing the gophers out of the back yard forced them out into\r\nthe front.  So we called a gopher abatement guy.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> He's really good at what he does.  And he thinks the mesh is a\r\nmistake.  It is, in his words, \"The worst thing we could have done.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> His argument is simple: the gophers are still under the back yard,\r\nand the mesh makes getting rid of them harder.  In order to trap the\r\ngophers, he has to tear through the mesh with a shovel.  The result is\r\na ragged hole in the sod and (over time) a mesh polka-dotted with\r\nholes.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> He thinks the mesh is doing more harm than good.  He thinks it's\r\nin his way, and he'll be heavy-handed about getting it <em>out</em> of\r\nhis way.\r\n</p>\r\n<p> I think he's misunderstood our ultimate goal in installing the\r\nmesh.  Ultimately, we don't care about the gophers.  We just want our\r\nlawn to stay pretty.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <em>I</em> think the mesh limits the damage the gophers and the\r\ndogs can do, and so it's an asset I want to protect.  I don't really\r\ncare that the mesh makes <em>his</em> job marginally harder.  I care\r\nthat it keeps the yard in <em>radically</em> better shape.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> And, as promised, home ownership has its privileges: <em>My house,\r\nmy rules.</em>\r\n</p>",

    "body": "<p> I. Hours of Operation\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> On Saturday, I upgraded my service with Time Warner Cable.  To\r\navoid the installation fee, I elected to pick up the receiver from the\r\nlocal office.  I told the customer service rep that I'd be headed over\r\nright away to pick it up, then hung up the phone.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Unfortunately, I got tied up working on a few things around the\r\nhouse, and realized I'd better check the hours of operation for the\r\nlocal office, to make sure I got there before they closed.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I hopped on Google Maps, found the local office, and dialed the\r\nnumber.  I was connected to a customer service rep who told me that\r\nthe Simi Valley office is closed on weekends.  She suggested I try the\r\nChatsworth office.  When I said that Chatsworth is out of my way, and\r\nasked for other options, she didn't have any.  She suggested that I'd\r\nbe better off searching on Google Maps.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>II. Chat Online with an Agent</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I wanted to look at my old statements, so I went to Time Warner\r\nCable's web site.  I clicked on \"PayExpress\", and was taken to a page\r\ntitled, \"Failure\", which said that my browser (Chrome) isn't\r\nsupported.  A\r\nfailure <a href=\"http://www.w3schools.com/browsers/browsers_stats.asp\">indeed</a>.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> So I fired up Safari, and went back to Time Warner Cable's site.\r\nAgain, I clicked on \"PayExpress\".  I logged in, and started hunting\r\nfor my old statements.  I couldn't find them, but I <em>did</em> find\r\na button labeled, \"Chat Online wiht an Agent.\"  I clicked it.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> The agent told me to log in.  I said I was already logged in.  She\r\ntold me to click on \"PayExpress.\"  Clicking on \"PayExpress\" took me\r\nback to the login page.  I clicked \"log in\", and that took me back to\r\nthe account page, where a pop-up invited me to take a survey.  (I\r\ndeclined.)  The agent asked for my customer code again.  I gave her my\r\naccount number.  Evidently, that's the wrong thing.  She needed my\r\n\"customer code\" so she could \"verify\" my account, and once my account\r\nwas \"verified,\" I'd be able to look at my statements.  The \"customer\r\ncode\" appears on my <em>paper</em> statements.  Unfortunately, those\r\npaper statements always go straight to the garbage once I've read\r\nthem, because I do everything online.  So I don't <em>have</em> a\r\npaper statement, or my \"customer code.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> She said that wasn't a problem, and that she could verify my\r\naccount anyway.  (Then why was she asking for my customer code?)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> She told me to close my browser window and log in again.  I did.  When\r\nI logged back in, the chat session was gone, my account still\r\nwasn't \"verified,\" and I still couldn't see my old statements.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>III. Brick and Mortar</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Today, I checked Google Maps (as the customer service rep had\r\nsuggested on Saturday), and discovered that there was a Time Warner\r\nCable office very close to where I work.  30970 Russel Ranch Rd.  So I\r\nheaded over on my lunch hour.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I had a little trouble finding the building, so I called Time\r\nWarner Cable again.  The rep put me on hold for a few minutes, then\r\ngave me the direct number for the local office, and told me to go to\r\n30970 Russell Ranch Road.  (The same address Google has.)  When I\r\nfinally found the address, it was an out-of-business sports bar.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> So I dialed the phone number the rep gave me for the local office.\r\nI did not get the local office.  Instead, I got the national phone\r\nline again.  I talked to another rep, who said he didn't understand\r\nwhy I'd dialed the national line when I was looking for the local\r\noffice, and didn't know why the previous rep had given me that number.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I asked him to please just transfer me to the local office.  He\r\nagreed and put me on hold for a few minutes.  When he returned, he\r\nsaid the local office <em>has no phone number</em>, but that he would\r\nconnect me.  After a few more minutes on hold, a recorded message said\r\nI'd reached a \"non-working Time Warner Cable number\", and then I was\r\ndisconnected.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>IV. Verified</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> At long last, I reached the Time Warner Cable office in Newbury\r\nPark.  The staff there was <em>awesome</em>.  They answered my\r\nquestions clearly, fixed all my problems, and gave me all the\r\ninformation I needed.  They did't even mind that I'd accidentally\r\nparked in the employee parking area.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I told them about the fiasco at 30970 Russell Ranch Rd.  She said\r\nshe'd let them know.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Coda</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> When I got home last night, there was a note on my door from Time\r\nWarner Cable letting me know that a technician had been there to\r\ninstall my receiver, and that I should call to reschedule.  When I\r\ncalled to remind Time Warner Cable that I <em>did not want a tech to\r\ninstall my receiver</em>, I discovered that I'd already been booked\r\nfor a visit from a tech tomorrow between 1:00 and 5:00 PM.\r\n</p>\r\n"

But I made huge gains\r\nover the last time I tried. I no longer feel like Hummingbird is\r\nfull-suspension-only territory. In fact, I'm confident I'll ride it\r\nclean... eventually.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> And on Friday, I took a short spin around Wildwood park. I\r\nsteered clear of most of the technical stuff, and just took it easy,\r\nenjoying the breeze and the scenery.  What a great way to finish out a\r\nbig week of riding.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I also discovered that there's a new (to me) trail in Wildwood park: a connector trail between the Santa Rosa and Lower Santa Rosa trails.  Evidently, this was <a href=\"http://www.srvtrails.com/PROPOSALfor%20Santa%20Rosa%20Connector%20Trail%208-19-08.pdf\">proposed</a> a while back, and it's great to see that it's been built.  I've never ridden the Lower Santa Rosa or Box Canyon trails, so I can't wait to get back out there.\r\n</p>\r\n",

    "body": "\r\n<p> With that, there were two options:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n  <li> Climb Dead Cow Road.\r\n  <li> Just wander, and look for something new.\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p> For logistical reasons, I'd have to change into my bike clothes at\r\nthe trailhead, so whatever path I took once on the bike, I decided to\r\nstart from the Cheeseboro trailhead.  I wanted to work on both\r\ntechnical sections along the Cheeseboro Canyon Trail, and after that,\r\nI could go wherever I wanted.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> The technical work that I've done on Chumash is paying off.  The\r\nfirst technical section on the canyon trail went clean on the first\r\ntry.  <a href=\"archive/2628\">The Wall</a> was tougher, so I split it\r\ninto two sections.  I did the first section without trouble, but had\r\nto work on the second.  I got it on the third try, and thought about\r\ngoing back to put it all together, but decided not to get greedy.  I\r\nrealized that I had unconsciously decided to ride Dead Cow, and didn't\r\nwant to burn out my legs chasing perfection when there was plenty\r\ndifficult climbing ahead.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> The Sheep Corral trail is an old favorite of mine, even if it no\r\nlonger challenges me the way it used to.  The first time I managed to\r\nride that trail was just a few days after I tested for my Krav Maga\r\nyellow belt.  I remember leaning forward on my bike, panting, close to\r\ntotal detonation, thinking: \"I got through my test.  I can do this.\r\nKeep pedaling.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Soon enough, I was at China Flat, and it was time for new\r\nterritory.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Dead Cow is an <em>awesome</em> downhill.  I passed a couple of\r\nguys pushing their bikes up from King James Court, and we said hello.\r\nThey said, \"How're you doing?\" I answered, \"Too early to tell.  I'll\r\nfind out when I have to climb back up this beast.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I passed a mother and daughter hiking up.  \"You're brave!\" she\r\nsaid.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> \"Or just stupid!\" I answered.  \"We'll see!\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I walked just a single five-yard stretch on the way down.  It\r\ninvolved a drop into a gnarly rut, and I just wasn't up for it.  It\r\nwas one of those lines where you'll <em>probably</em> be fine, but if\r\nyou're <em>not</em> fine, you're screwed.  Scrapes and bruises and\r\nmaybe worse.  So yeah, I walked.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Before I knew it, I was at the bottom.  With my car miles away on\r\nthe other side of a climb back <em>up</em> Dead Cow.  I rested, drank\r\nsome water, ate a Gu, posted my self-inflicted predicament to\r\nFacebook, and then got rolling again.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I don't think I've ever had so much fun on a climb.  It was really\r\nhard, but riding so much over the last couple of weeks has given me\r\nstrong legs that recover quickly, improved technique, and the\r\nconfidence to leverage both to attack technical sections I wouldn't\r\nhave considered rideable before.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> On the way back up, I discovered an narrow alternate line that let\r\nme climb the section I'd walked on the downhill.  That went clean on\r\nthe second try, and I continued with a grin on my face.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> And I met up with the mother and daughter again.  As I passed, I\r\nsaid, \"Turns out I'm stupid-- now I have to <em>climb</em> this\r\nthing!\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> She turned to me and said, \"Oh, no!  Are you stuck?  Do you need\r\nhelp?\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I stopped, \"No, I'm sorry, I was just joking.  Everything's fine.\r\nI'm having a great time!\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> She was surprised to learn that I'd pedaled over from Cheeseboro,\r\nand we talked about different options for hikes in the area, and then\r\nthey headed down the trail, and I continued up.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> A few minutes later, I met up with the guys who'd been pushing\r\ntheir bikes up the trail.  I pulled over to let them roll past, and\r\nthe first one stopped to talk.  \"Dude, you're <em>climbing</em> this\r\nthing?\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> \"Yeah,\" I said.  \"But I <em>am</em> starting to wonder what I've\r\ngotten my ass into.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> They laughed, and we talked for a minute about local trails, and\r\nthey filled me in on a couple of other options in Oak Park.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> And then it was time to climb some more.  I only had to walk one\r\nsection, and I'll be back for that.  I got the sense that with a\r\nlittle more power and fresh muscles, I'd have it.  Maybe.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I hit the top of Dead Cow, pulled on my arm warmers, and had a\r\nfantastic time rolling downhill all the way home.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I did <em>not</em> try to ride down The Wall, but took a new, more\r\nchallenging line down the first technical patch that I'd ridden up\r\nearlier.  Just trying new stuff, enjoying the scenery, and enjoying\r\nthe day.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> And I'm grinning just thinking about this Thursday, when I get to\r\ndo this all again, if I want.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Gear Notes</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> A few key gear upgrades made this easily the best day on the bike\r\nsince I started riding again.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Grips:</b> I replaced the mushy, quickly-shredding stock Giant\r\nbar grips with Sram locking grips.  They're firmer, but grippier, and\r\nI really felt like I had more feel and control.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Seat Clamp:</b> I replaced the Crank Bros. quick release seat clamp with one from\r\nSalsa, and it's a night-and-day difference.  With the Crank Bros., the\r\nsaddle would slip slowly down as I rode, losing maybe a cm each mile.\r\nThe Salsa held solid all day, with zero slippage.  Awesome.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Brakes:</b> And most notably, I replaced the stock Avid Elixir\r\n1 brakes with Avid XO brakes.  Fantastic power, amazing modulation,\r\ntotal control.  So, so worth the money.  (And so nice to have on a\r\ntricky downhill like Dead Cow.)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Fork:</b> My fork felt slightly mushy, but I loved it.  Gotta\r\ncheck the pressure when I get home tonight.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Having real numbers\r\nto work is <em>great</em>.  The manufacturer's suggested pressure for\r\nthis fork, and my current weight (~180 lbs) is 50 lbs of pressure.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Previously, I'd had it at about 30 lbs of pressure, which was\r\ngreat on the downhill, but too cush for pedaling.  So I decided to\r\npump it up to the manufacturer's spec, and see how that went.  \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> 50 lbs is too stiff, judging by how it felt on the very rocky\r\nChumash trail.  <em>And</em> it puts the sag at about 15mm, which\r\njibes with it being a bit too firm.  (Zinn recommends 20% sag.)  So\r\nI'm going to adjust until I hit 20mm of sag.  (Which\r\nis <em>radically</em> easier when the pump has a pressure dial.)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I also tried pushing the pressure on the back tire up to 35 lbs, and didn't like it: less smooth, less grippy.  30 lbs in both tires seems to be the sweet spot for the moment. \r\n</p>",

So earlier this week, I scoped\r\nout a few new trails to ride this weekend.  And with most of the day\r\nto myself, I had time to go anywhere, ride whatever I wanted.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> But as I got ready to head out, I realized that I wanted to head\r\nback to the Chumash trail.  I wanted to work on the technical climbing\r\nsections, and I wanted to explore the \"White Oaks Park\" area between\r\nYosemite and Kuehner Dr.  I was hoping to find a trail between the\r\nHummingbird and Chumash trailheads, sort of, but mostly I'd just never\r\nbeen down there, and thought it might be a fun way to extend a ride up\r\n& down Chumash.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I managed to ride the whole trail, bottom to top.  But several\r\nsections took a few tries, so it'll be some time before I'll be\r\ncelebrating a clean ascent of this trail.  Still, after years of\r\nwondering if I'd <em>ever</em> be able to climb some of these\r\nsections, it's enormously satisfying.  Especially after climbing the\r\nrock garden section, I'm feeling really strong.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> And I had a great time exploring the lesser-traveled trails.  One\r\nin particular, I will <em>not</em> be returning to.  The \"shortcut\"\r\nbetween Chumash and the water tower is bikable only until it\r\ndrops <em>very</em> steeply toward the water tower.  And it's not much\r\nfun.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> The rest, however, provided a fun, easy extension to the ride, and should provide a nice all-dirt alternate route between the Hummingbird and Chumash trailheads.\r\n</p>\r\n",

Time to think about going tubeless.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Patching and re-mounting the 26'' tube went easily.  I've been\r\ncarrying a 29'' spare tube.  Going to switch to a 26'' tube.

    "intro": "<p> For a while, I've only had three ways to bike to the top of Rocky\r\nPeak.  From the north, via the Las Llajas Fire Rd, from the east up\r\nJohnson Fire Rd, and from the South, via the Rocky Peak Fire Rd.\r\nThere are two trails up the west side of Rocky Peak: Chumash and\r\nHummingbird.  And Hummingbird is rough enough going <em>down</em>.  So\r\nclimbing Chumash has been on my mind for a while.  Partly because I've\r\njust never done it, and partly because it would mean a more fun,\r\nchallenging route to the top, and open up more options for how to get\r\ndown.\r\n</p>\r\n",
    "body": "<p> I'd been planning on a two-hour ride, but by the time I actually\r\nheaded out, it was after three o'clock, and sunset was fast\r\naproaching.  Rather than try one of my usual loops and risk getting\r\ncaught in the dark if I flatted, I decided to start my \"Climb Chumash\"\r\nproject.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I wasn't set on actually reaching the top, and decided that\r\nwherever I was at 4:40, I'd turn and head down so as not to get caught\r\nin the dark.  (Sunset these days is at about 4:50, with full dark\r\nabout 25 minutes after that.)  I took my time.  I tried a couple of\r\nsections several times before getting them right, and simply hiked\r\nthrough others rather than burn out my legs.  \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> And despite not really aiming to reach the top, at 4:40 the Fire\r\nRd was in sight, and I decided that stretching my turn-around time a\r\nfew minutes was worth it to at least reach a more satisfying\r\nmilestone.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p> I'm really glad I did.  I've been descending Chumash for years,\r\nand in that time, there have been a couple of technical sections that\r\nhave thwarted my attempts to get the whole thing clean.  Over time, I\r\ngot stronger, and all but one of those sections eventually became\r\nfairly easy for me.  But there's one that continues to be a problem.\r\nIt's two hard moves followed by some easy stuff: a set of broken\r\nrocks, then a slight left over a momentum-killing bump, and then a few\r\nyards of stone that are easy if you're settled and on-balance, and\r\nrough otherwise.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Last night, that work paid off.  I hopped up those rocks on the\r\nfirst try, and had to remind myself to concentrate through the rest of\r\nthe section.  After that, I was grinning all the way down, just\r\nenjoying the feeling that keeps me getting back on my bike over and\r\nover again: <i>Today, I did something I couldn't do yesterday.</i>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> It's two moves, really.  And it's two moves that a thousand other\r\nlocal bikers roll with ease.  But it's two moves that I've never, ever\r\ngotten on my first try, and it feels really good to devote some time\r\nand attention to becoming a better rider, and having it pay off like\r\nthis.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> So I'll be continuing my project.  Now that I've cleaned Chumash\r\nall the way down, I'd love to be able to ride it all the way\r\n<em>up</em>.  If I recall correctly, there are just three sections I\r\ncan't yet ride.  Time to start knocking those down.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> And time to start looking for difficult technical riding closer to\r\nthe trailhead.  Part of me dreads having to climb for 30 minutes just\r\nto get to the thing I actually want to work on...\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n"

    "intro": "<p> I've been told it's not a popular trail, but I have to say that\r\nthe Johnson Fire Rd is one of my favorite rides around here.  Unfortunately, access can be problematic.  The base\r\nof Johnson is in a gated community, and the guards at the gate on\r\nIverson Rd. are... somewhat stern.  One didn't have a problem with me\r\ndrafting behind a car to get through, but refused to open the gate, or\r\nlet me through the gates for foot traffic.  I've had good luck getting\r\nthrough the gate on Poema Pl, but I'm not sure how reliable either of\r\nthese options is.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Which is to say that I wasn't keen on coasting all the way down\r\nSanta Susana Rd. only to be stymied by security folks.  Instead, I\r\ndoubled my afternoon's fun by riding up Rocky Peak from Rocky Peak\r\nRd., then <em>down</em> Johnson Fire Rd, then turning around and\r\npedaling right back <em>up</em> Johnson Fire Rd, then back down Rocky\r\nPeak Fire Rd.\r\n</p>\r\n",
    "body": "<p> I conserved a lot of energy heading up Rocky Peak Fire Rd., and\r\nhit the top of Johnson feeling strong, but not especially fluid.  I'm\r\ncoming to think that descending Johnson Fire Rd. requires a more cush\r\nsuspension than I've set up on my bike.  I added a pound or two of\r\npressure to the fork for this ride, and set the damping a bit slower.\r\nCombined, I felt a lot more strain in my thumbs and a lot less\r\nsmoothness in my riding.  The good news is that I can let that\r\npressure back out, and have another spin and see how that feels.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Climbing back up Johnson was a bit of a mental trip.  On long\r\nclimbs, my legs settle into a rhythm where they're burning, but the\r\nburning isn't getting worse.  It's a steady state of suffering, and\r\nfinding my way to that state is usually the reason I do long rides.\r\nBecause once you're there for a bit, the burning goes away, replaced\r\nby endless energy and all the torque I need.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Anyway, I usually reach that point a little distance up Johnson\r\nFire Rd.  And if I'm out of shape, there's a section of the road that\r\nplays with my head. It's about a mile long, and it gets progressively\r\nsteeper and more technical, and makes me wonder if I'm really up for\r\nthis.  (Johnson is longer, steeper, more technical, and\r\ngains <em>far</em> more elevation than Rocky Peak Fire Rd.)  And once\r\nI've gotten past that, and I'm just about cooked and I'm wishing for\r\nthe comparative ease of a dusty, wheezing grind back up to the peak,\r\nJohnson hits you with the steepest, most technical section yet.  I've\r\ntried to ride it a few times, and always needed to sit and rest after\r\ntwo or three attempts.  Several times, I've opted to skip the torture\r\nand just walked it.  For quite a while, it's been the only section of\r\nJohnson Fire Rd. I couldn't ride up.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> But yesterday, I got it on my second try.  So I'm pretty happy\r\nabout that.  \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> And once that was behind me, all the technical climbing was done\r\nfor the day, and I could just have fun.  I didn't have to think about\r\nsaving any energy.  I pedaled back up to the peak, then down the fire\r\nroad.  I'd forgotten how much fun that fire road is, if you forget\r\nabout trying to go fast and just relax and take your time.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> After I was home and fed and cleaned up and sitting on the couch\r\nwith Henri, I realized that I'd developed a pretty killer headache.  I\r\nalso realized that I'd felt this before after other tough rides.  I\r\nusually have a few glasses of water, and it mostly goes away.  But\r\nlast night, it wouldn't quit.  So I Googled \"post-workout headache\",\r\nand\r\nfound <a href=\"http://www.thatsfit.ca/2010/02/04/post-workout-headaches-consider-your-electrolytes/\">this\r\narticle</a>, which mentions athletes that do tough workouts (check!),\r\nsweat a lot (check!), and drank only water (check!).  The article has\r\na recipe for a quick home-made electrolyte replacement drink:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li> 1.5 cups of water\r\n  <li> a pinch of sea salt\r\n  <li> one tablespoon of maple syrup\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p> I have all those things in my cupboard, so I gave it a shot.\r\n(Though I added a little extra sea salt and syrup to the mix.)  And\r\nwouldn't you know it-- two glasses later, my headache started to fade.\r\nBefore long, it was gone completely.  I'll be keeping that recipe in\r\nmy back pocket for quite a while.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> And I'll be using a real sports drink in my CamelBak from now on.\r\nWater just doesn't do it on rides longer than 2 hours or so.  (I like\r\nHydro-Boom and <a href=\"http://www.carborocket.com\">CarboRocket</a>.)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> So, I have some adjustments to make for next time: ease back the\r\nair pressure on my fork, and stock up on sports drink mix to keep me\r\nrolling and avoid dehydration headaches.  \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> And I'm going to do a little research on sports drinks.  There was\r\nan excellent intro to the topic at\r\n<a href=\"http://sciencebasedrunning.com/2011/08/whats-the-ideal-running-drink-noakes-weighs-in/\">Science-Based\r\nRunning</a> a while back, so I'll start there, and see if there are\r\nbetter options out there than what I've already tried.  (And I'm also\r\ninterested in finding an option with some protein for rides in the\r\nfour-hour range and longer.)\r\n</p>\r\n"

In general I am used to managing life on my own;\r\nwhen I need help, I am not shy about asking.  So there is no need to\r\noffer to help me.  Moreover, being constantly offered help is actually\r\nquite distracting and tiresome.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>So please, unless I am in grave immediate danger, please don't offer\r\nhelp.  The nicest thing you can do is help when I ask, and otherwise\r\nnot worry about how I am doing.  Meanwhile, you can also ask me for\r\nhelp when you need it.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>One situation where I do not need help, let alone supervision, is in\r\ncrossing streets.  I grew up in the middle of the world's biggest\r\ncity, full of cars, and I have crossed streets without assistance even\r\nin the chaotic traffic of Bangalore and Delhi.  Please just leave me\r\nalone when I cross streets.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>In some places, my hosts act as if my every wish were their command.\r\nBy catering to my every whim, in effect they make me a tyrant over\r\nthem, which is not a role I like.  I start to worry that I might\r\nsubject them to great burdens without even realizing.  I start being\r\nafraid to express my appreciation of anything, because they would get\r\nit and give it to me at any cost.  If it is night, and the stars are\r\nbeautiful, I hesitate to say so, lest my hosts feel obligated to try\r\nto get one for me.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>When I'm trying to decide what to do, often I mention things that\r\nMIGHT be nice to do--depending on more details, if it fits the\r\nschedule, if there isn't a better alternative, etc.  Some hosts take\r\nsuch a tentative suggestion as an order, and try moving heaven and\r\nearth to make it happen.  This excessive rigidity is not only quite\r\nburdensome for other people, it can even fail in its goal of pleasing\r\nme.  If there is a better alternative, I'd rather be flexible and\r\nchoose it instead--so please tell me.  If my tentative suggestion\r\nimposes a lot of trouble on others, I want to drop it--so please tell\r\nme.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When you need to tell me about a problem in a plan, please do not\r\nstart with a long apology.  That is unbearably boring, and unnecessary\r\n-- conveying useful information is helpful and good, and why apologize\r\nfor that?  So please be practical and go straight to the point.\r\n</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p> So many rules.  So, so many rules.\r\n</p>",

    "body": "<p> <b>You need good tools.</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Several times over the last year, I've stood in the hardware store\r\ndebating a purchase.  Good tools make a <em>huge</em> difference, but\r\nit's sometimes tough to stomach the price.  These are the tools that\r\nI've found I <em>genuinely</em> need, and use all the time:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li> Toolbox.  Get a toolbox big enough for all your basic tools.\r\n  It doesn't need to hold a drill, or sledgehammer, etc.  But it\r\n  should hold everything <em>else</em>.  \r\n  </li>\r\n\r\n  <li> Workbench. We repurposed a large, heavy home-built table we\r\n  found in the back yard when we moved in.  It's been <em>key</em> to\r\n  nearly all the work I've done on the house.  Have a dedicated place\r\n  where you can hammer, drill, saw, and paint without fear of damaging\r\n  anything.\r\n  </li>\r\n\r\n  <li> Garbage can.  Don't repurpose the household can.  Get a can\r\n  just for the garage and DIY projects.  (More on this below.)\r\n  </li>\r\n\r\n  <li> Black &amp; Decker battery-powered hand drill.  The battery\r\n  lasts for ages, there's plenty of power, and it's easy to use.\r\n  Adjustable torque lets me avoid over-driving screws.\r\n  </li>\r\n\r\n  <li>Drill bit set.  I have a 20-piece Dewalt set, and\r\n  it's <em>awesome</em>.  (Also get some phillips and flat-head screw\r\n  driver bits.)\r\n  </li>\r\n\r\n  <li> Measuring tape.  It's worth getting a good one.  I have a\r\n  Stanley LeverLock, and it's awesome.\r\n  </li>\r\n\r\n  <li> Two large C-clamps.  Put a piece of scrap wood between the\r\n  clamp and the item you want to pin down.\r\n  </li>\r\n\r\n  <li> <a href=\"http://www.sears.com/shc/s/p_10153_12605_00947483000P?prdNo=48&blockNo=48&blockType=G48\">Craftsman\r\n  Bit Screwdriver</a>.  That's the one I have.  Get it.  (I also have\r\n  an adapter that lets me plug the bits from this set into my power\r\n  drill.  <em>Super</em>-handy.)\r\n  </li>\r\n\r\n  <li> Nail punch.  Trust me.\r\n  </li>\r\n\r\n  <li> Mechanical carpenter's pencil.  Never dull, always handy.\r\n  </li>\r\n\r\n  <li> <a href=\"http://www.homedepot.com/h_d1/N-5yc1v/R-202634478/h_d2/ProductDisplay?langId=-1&storeId=10051&catalogId=10053\">Pry bar</a>.  \r\n  </li>\r\n\r\n  <li> Table saw or miter saw.  (Or maybe a circular saw, in a pinch.)\r\n  I have a table saw, and if I ever have to go through another season\r\n  of home repair like this one, I'm buying a good compound miter saw.\r\n  The foundation of any wood working project is making a straight,\r\n  accurate cut, and you can't do that with hand tools.  If you're\r\n  doing baseboards or crown molding, get a compound miter saw, not a\r\n  table or circular saw.\r\n  </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p> This is <em>far</em> from an exhaustive list.  There is plety of\r\nbasic stuff (hammer, level) that everyone has already.  I tried to\r\nfocus on the stuff that surprised <em>me</em> with how useful it is,\r\nand the stuff I initially thought I could do without.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I'm also leaving out stuff for the yard.  That's a whole other\r\nlist, and far weirder.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Bring your whole toolbox.</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> It's tempting to go into the garage and grab just the tools you\r\nneed.  But that's a mistake.  Don't think, don't hesitate, just grab\r\nyour whole toolbox and take it with you.  Otherwise, you'll spend half\r\nyour afternoon walking through the house to go get whatever you need\r\nnext.  (Hammer... measuring tape... pencil... nail punch... sand\r\npaper... <em>other</em> screw driver...)  And when you're done with\r\nthe job, you have a bunch of stuff that you can't carry back to the\r\ngarage all in one trip.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Take everything with you the first time.  After all, that's why\r\nyou have a toolbox.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Bring the garbage can.</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> You <em>think</em> you're going to save time by just dumping\r\neverything on the floor and gathering it up all at once when you're\r\ndone.  That's an illusion.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> If you have a trash bin handy, you just dump the trash in the can.\r\nDone.  If you <em>don't</em> have a trash bin, you dump the trash on\r\nthe floor and <em>then you have to pick it up and put it in the bin\r\nanyway</em>.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Don't put your tools down.</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> There are three acceptable places for tools.  In your hand, in\r\nyour belt/pocket, or in your toolbox.  Don't put them down and walk\r\naway.  Something always gets misplaced.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Carefully inspect all orders on arrival.</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> When the custom doors arrived, I should have opened the box and\r\nconfirmed that the doors were undamaged, had all the necessary\r\nhardware, and were of the expected size.  \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>When going to the hardware store, take a sample.</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> If you need to replace something, take the old thing with you.  Or\r\ntake the thing it has to fit with.  And when you can't do that,\r\nmeasure obsessively, and take a picture with your cellphone for\r\nreference.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Write down all the paints you've used.</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Behr's \"high-gloss interior white enamel\" is slightly more yellow\r\nthan Glidden's.  And if you've picked custom colors or had them mixed\r\nat the store, all bets are off.  If you don't have the <em>exact</em>\r\nname of the color you used, you're going to spend an extra $35 on\r\nsamples so that you can go home and see which one matches your paint.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> This is going to feel unnecessary at first.  But later, when you\r\nfeel like you need this information, it's going to be a royal pain to\r\ngather, because <em>every custom color comes in the same can marked\r\n\"pure white\".</em>  It'll have a little label on the top that says\r\nwhich custom color it is, but that label will be (wait for it) covered\r\nin paint.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> When we moved in, I created a house wiki, and I've been steadily\r\nstuffing random information into it as we go.  It's already saved\r\nme <em>multiple</em> trips to the store, because I can pull it up on\r\nmy iPhone and double-check my memory.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Wear \"painting clothes\" to paint.</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> No matter how small the job is, paint <em>will</em> get on you or\r\nyour clothes.  Accept this, and don't even open a can of paint until\r\nyou have on your junky painting clothes.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Don't be Afraid</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> A hundred times, I've been tempted to \"mickey mouse\" something to\r\navoid what I thought would be a bigger job.  I've resisted that\r\ntemptation whenever possible, and I'm glad.  When I look around my\r\nhouse, I <em>don't</em> see all the shortcuts I took.  Instead, I see\r\nwork that I'm proud of, even if it <em>is</em> clearly done by a\r\nbeginner.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> You <em>can</em> figure out how to fix doors, towell racks,\r\ndeadbolts, screen doors, sprinklers, and anything else in the house.\r\nBe patient, measure twice, cut once.  \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> And when you really, really just can't take any more, don't be afraid to hire a\r\nprofessional.  And when you do, skip the story about how you got into\r\nthis mess.  Just say, \"I got in over my head.  Here's what we need,\"\r\nand then get out of their way.\r\n</p>\r\n"

    "intro": "<p>We decided on accordion-style doors for the office closet, and\r\n  measured the opening.  It had originally been the standard 80'' high,\r\n  but with the new carpet, it was more like 78&frac12''.  So we ordered\r\n  custom-cut doors from Home Depot.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since the opening was 78&frac12'', and we'd need about an inch on top\r\n  for the hardware, and an inch or so of floor clearance on the bottom\r\n  so it wouldn't rub on the carpet, we ordered 77'' doors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It took two weeks for the doors to arrive.  When we went to pick them\r\n  up, one end of the box had clearly been smashed, so I checked\r\n  carefully to make sure we had all the hardware, and that the door\r\n  inside seemed okay.  \"If the door is damaged,\" the associate told us,\r\n  \"just bring 'em back.  No worries.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The doors wouldn't fit in either of our cars, so we rented a Home\r\n  Depot pickup truck for $20, and took the doors home.  It was a\r\n  weeknight, and we didn't have the time, energy, or space to get\r\n  started painting the doors, so we stood the box in the office.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Over the next few weeks, we made wedding plans, attended birthday\r\n  parties, and did all the \"life is what happens when you're busy making\r\n  other plans\" stuff.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When I finally opened the box, it was clear that the doors were\r\n  damaged.  So I called Home Depot.  I was told that they \"didn't really\r\n  like to take returns for custom merchandise,\" and that the\r\n  manufacturer \"might not want to exchange them\", and that they'd \"see\r\n  what our options are.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"Let me be clear,\" I said.  \"The doors arrived damaged.  Either I get\r\n  new doors, or I drop off the ones I have and dispute the charge with\r\n  Visa.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They said they'd order new doors.  Just this once.  And they'd deliver\r\n  them so I din't have to rent their truck again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The new doors arrived two weeks later, and after several phone calls\r\n  to remind them that the doors should be <em>delivered</em>, not held\r\n  for pick up, they were at our house.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We got up the following Saturday morning and put down sheets of\r\n  plastic, and painted the doors the same glossy white as our interior\r\n  trim.  It took three coats, which took two days to do.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And when that was done, I realized that the original hardware that\r\n  came with the doors two months ago was missing.  Somewhere in the\r\n  house, or the garage, or maybe in a toolbox somewhere, were the little\r\n  metal pieces I needed to put up the doors.  I had <em>half</em> of\r\n  what I needed: the replacement doors had come with <em>one</em> bag of\r\n  hardware, but I needed two.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So I took the one bag I had, and headed for Home Depot.  The staff\r\n  there found a matching set of parts, and I headed home to finally put\r\n  the doors up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I hammered in the hardware, and screwed the top guide into the lintel\r\n  above the closet, and stood the doors in the opening.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They were too short.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We'd measured the opening at 78&frac12;''.  And Home Depot had figured\r\n  in some padding around the doors, and ordered 77'' doors.  Masonite\r\n  (the company that made the doors) had assumed that 77'' was the size\r\n  of the <em>opening</em>, and figured in <em>more</em> padding.  So the\r\n  doors were <em>actually</em> 75'' high.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I could try to return two-month-old custom doors that had already been\r\n  painted, but I decided to do the simple thing: add a header board\r\n  under the lintel and make the opening about 2'' smaller.  So that's what I did.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I got a 2x2, cut it to length, drilled holes in it with wide openings\r\n  so the screws for the header board wouldn't get in the way of the\r\n  guide track for the door, spent two nights painting it (wrecking a\r\n  pair of shorts in the process when the paint can spit at me), and was\r\n  finally ready to put everything together.  Except I didn't have screws\r\n  long enough.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Off to Home Depot again.  I got 2&frac12;'' wood screws, which were\r\n  perfect.  I accidentally got flat-head screws.  Not so perfect, but\r\n  workable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I screwed in the header board, attached the guide track, and stood the\r\n  doors in the opening.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The doors were now too tall.  The header board was too thick.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To this day, I still don't know how this can be.  It's mathematically\r\n  impossible.  The doors were 2'' too short, but when I made the opening\r\n  2'' smaller, the doors were too tall.  Impossible, but true.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So I started removing the 2&frac12; flat-head screws.  And because\r\n  they were flat-head instead of phillips, and because they were cheap\r\n  metal, the head on the first screw completely stripped when I tried to\r\n  unscrew it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The others came out with time and patience, but that first one wasn't\r\n  budging.  Luckily, I managed to get a hacksaw in between the header\r\n  board and the lintel, and <em>cut</em> the screw so I could remove the\r\n  header board.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Back I went to Home Depot, with the header board in hand.  I knew they\r\n  could plane off the top 1'' of it, and then I could use it to mount\r\n  the doors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I also grabbed the oldest guy I could find, and asked if he could show\r\n  me some screws that wouldn't strip.  He pointed me to some\r\n  good-quality stainless steel phillips head screws.  Awesome.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Next up, I talked to a guy in the lumber department.  He was happy to\r\n  plane my 2x2 down to a 1x2, but couldn't.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After all, there was a steel screw still stuck in it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So I bought an 80'' length of 1x2 and six good-quality screws, and\r\n  headed home.  I drilled new countersunk holes in five minutes, and put\r\n  a coat of paint on the new header board.  Later that day, I put the\r\n  second coat on. And the day after that, I put a third coat on, just to\r\n  be sure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And last night, everything finally, <em>finally</em> came together.\r\n  The header board fit.  The new screws went in perfectly, and\r\n  everything was the right size.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>So the picture above might look like a small thing, but it's the end\r\n  of a three-month saga of rookie mistakes and uncooperative vendors,\r\n  and it feels really, <em>really</em> good to have it done.</p>\r\n\r\n",

    "intro": "<p> The <a href=\"http://www.ruckus.org/\">Ruckus Society</a> came to\r\ncampus for a 3&frac12;-hr training session yesterday, which\r\nwas <em>really</em> cool.  I signed up on impulse, thinking\r\nsimply <i>How cool is it that I work at a place that will pay me to\r\nget trained in productive civil disobedience?</i>\r\n</p>\r\n",
    "body": "<p> I half expected a lecture on how to get arrested.  But the Ruckus\r\nSociety's techniques are all focused entirely on non-violent,\r\nminimally illegal means.  They're focused on achieving goals, not\r\nsimply throwing tantrums, which I thought was <em>awesome</em>.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> The first exercise was simple: break into groups, and take two\r\nminutes to design our ideal community.  We huddled on the floor around\r\nposter-sized sheets of paper, and scribbled quickly.  Terms like\r\n\"health care\", \"safety\", \"open spaces\" and \"wildlife\" appeared, and\r\nour group playfully drew a yurt in the heart of our community.  We\r\ntalked about sustainable business, renewable power, plentiful space to\r\nsurf, bike, hike, run, play (we're an outdoorsy bunch).\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> The Ruckus instructor arrived wearing a huge nametag: \"Joe from\r\nGREEN, Inc.\"  He talked about offering us a deal: we'd each get $20,\r\nand some cash for our local schools, and a source of renewable,\r\nlow-pollution energy if we let him build a dam across our river.  We\r\nsaid no, since he blew off questions about environmental impact, and\r\nbecause we wanted to keep our local fishing industry.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> We knew he'd be back, so we decided to pitch <em>him</em> the idea\r\nof solar cells instead of a damn.  Everyone wins, right?\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> At this point, each group got up and discussed their community,\r\nand then it was time for another round of community designing,\r\ncross-pollenating with ideas from other groups.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> \"Joe\" from GREEN, Inc, returned, and we pitched our solar cell\r\nidea.  He said it was a great idea, and then told us that he'd\r\nreceived permits for the dam and construction was already beginning,\r\nand tore off the \"beach and river\" portion of our paper community.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Across the room, another group had decided on a different course\r\nof action: when \"Joe\" returned to their community, they sat in a\r\ncircle around their paper, and wouldn't let him get close.  Awesome.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> So, <a href=\"archive/1681\">Prof. Pausch</a> would be proud: the\r\ngame was a total head-fake.  It wasn't about establishing goals and\r\nnegotiating skills.  It was an introduction to power imbalances, the\r\nclassic playbook of governments and corporations, and a tiny, tiny\r\ntaste of what it feels like to have something you create violated.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> We also talked about the current \"Occupy Wall Street\" protests in\r\nmore technical terms.  Direct action is the <em>last</em> step, the\r\nthing that achieves some concrete goal that a group has been working\r\ntoward for some time.  Occupy Wall Street is using direct action\r\nto <em>build</em> the movement, rather than to reach a concrete goal.\r\nThey're <a href=\"http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2010/08/sell-the-problem.html\">selling\r\nthe problem</a> first, which <em>could</em> turn out to be really\r\neffective if they can follow through with a diciplined message and\r\nconcrete, achievable goals.)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I took a <em>lot</em> away from this.  I have a new appreciation\r\nfor the <a href=\"http://globalguerrillas.typepad.com/\">Global\r\nGurrellas</a> blog, which looks at power imbalances and has a running\r\ntheme of conflict as resource management. (Time, money, public\r\ngoodwill.)  GG covers <em>all</em> forms of conflict, including\r\nterrorism, civil war, and cyber attacks/hacktivism, so it's\r\nnot <em>completely</em> applicable to Ruckus's non-violent direct\r\naction techniques, but the basic principles are enlightening.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I also learned a lot about public relations.  Clear messaging\r\nis <em>critical</em> when trying to build awareness of a cause.  Build\r\nclarity first, <em>then</em> build depth of understanding.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> There's also no such thing as \"community outreach\".  In any cause,\r\nthere are various, conflicted constituencies that must be considered,\r\nand building a coalition is a messy business.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Giving \"passive allies\" a way to help is a <em>powerful</em> means\r\nof building support.  Tipping neutral parties into weak allies, then\r\ngiving them an easy way to help is <em>huge</em>.  And using what\r\nleverage you have to move passive opponents into neutral territory\r\npulls support from under your opponents.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Don't try to convert \"active opponents\" to your cause.  It's not\r\ngoing to happen.  Stay focused on finding leverage, and removing\r\nsupport.  (Sound <a href=\"archive/1611\">familiar</a>?)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> The initial \"ideal community\" exercise was also about changing our\r\nmindset.  We all tended to think in terms of inter-<em>personal</em>\r\nrelationships.  So when \"Joe\" went away, we unconciously assumed that\r\nhe wouldn't take action without further negotiation.  The reality was\r\nthat he (or GREEN, Inc.) had gone ahead with their plans without us.\r\nThe lesson was that negotiations with corporations happen behind\r\nclosed doors, or in public meetings, or even in secret, and the public\r\nis often discouraged from attending.  If we want to be a part of the\r\ndiscussion, it's up to us to <em>insist</em> on being included.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n"

Yeah, seems silly to go to\r\n  the trouble of switching just to save 31g, but I find it equally silly\r\n  not to experiment and see what happens.

Which means\r\nI <em>can</em> do all this straight from my phone.  Awesome.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> A few tweaks to be made:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li> I want to try lowering the tire pressure.  I've been running at\r\n  ~37 lbs.  Should try ~32 lbs.\r\n  </li>\r\n\r\n  <li> I lowered the presure in my fork for this ride, and love the\r\n  more supple ride.  Unfortunately, it's a bit mushy, and I'm seeing\r\n  too much compression relative to the rockiness of this ride.

Because whenever I'm getting\r\nread to go on a trip, I type <code>make-project &lt;\r\n~/projects/travel</code>, and I get a Things project with all the\r\nusual stuff I need to do to go on the road.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Whenever anyone sends me an \"urgent\" email, they automatically get\r\na short, friendly note in reply that says, essentially, that I'll read\r\ntheir email in the next 15 minutes or so, but if they need me to get\r\ncrackin' right away, please give me a ring on the phone.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> And I've bound a few Quicksilver triggers to let me hop between\r\nvarious apps.  Cmd-Shift-Ctrl-T opens Things, -E gets me Entourage, -K\r\ngets me KeePass, and I've got a few set up that open particular\r\nwebsites, etc.  The net result is that I spend <em>far</em> less time\r\npushing data around.  An email becomes a Things task (Alt-T) which\r\ngets checked off (Cmd-.), then I hop back from the task the email\r\n(Alt-Shift-T), and reply that the work is done (Cmd-R).\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Oh,\r\nand <a href=\"http://www.smilesoftware.com/TextExpander/\">TextExpander</a>\r\nis <em>awesome</em>.  Saving me mountains of time.  There are a few\r\nthings I have to type at least two or three times a day.  For instance:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n  <p>Hi [whoever],\r\n  </p>\r\n\r\n  <p> These changes are done, and ready for proofing on dev1.\r\n  </p>\r\n  \r\n  <p> -Chris\r\n  </p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p> I just type rfpx, (mnemonic:\r\n\"<b>r</b>eady <b>f</b>or <b>p</b>roofing, go\"),\r\nand that whole message pops up, with the cursor\r\npositioned so I can just fill in the name and hit \"send.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Likewise, I create svn tags in a standard format.  I just type\r\nrbx, and it fills in the name of the release branch, with the cursor\r\nset so I can type in the one thing that changes.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> In other words, anything that I type a lot, or anything that I\r\ntype that has to be formatted <em>just so</em>, I make into a\r\nTextExpander snippet.  And it's <em>awesome</em> for fixing typos that\r\nI make all the time.  Ever gotten an email from me signed \"-Chirs\"?\r\nNever again.  TextExpander spots the mistake and turns it back into\r\n\"-Chris\".\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Oh, and if I want to turn something I've just written into a\r\nTextExpander snippet, I just select it and hit Cmd-Shift-Ctrl-S.  So\r\nnow I've started to automate the process of automating stuff.\r\n</p>\r\n"

    "intro": "<p> I finally bit the bullet and ordered the pedals I wanted for my\r\n  bike.  One vendor had a killer price, but they've been\r\n  (unsurprisingly) out of stock for a while.  I got tired of waiting,\r\n  and took my bowl full of spare change to the local CoinStar machine\r\n  and got an Amazon gift certificate.  (If you pick a gift cert. over\r\n  cash, they waive all fees, yay!)  That netted about $50, which mostly\r\n  covered new set of Crank Brothers Eggbeater 3 pedals.  Awesome.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> The eggbeaters say they run 278g per pair, and my old Time pedals\r\n  can double as medeval weapons at 433g, so I just shaved 155g off the\r\n  weight of my bike.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I've also been reading that a lot of bikers use 26'' tubes in\r\n  their 29'' tires.  Sounds crazy, but it saves about 100g of rotating\r\n  weight on each weel, which is nothing to sneeze at.  Last night I\r\n  checked their numbers:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li> Sunlite 29'' tube: 218g\r\n  <li> Giant 26'' tube: 172g\r\n  <li> Specialized Ultralight 26'' tube: 115g\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p> So yes, if I replace a regular 29'' tube with a $14 ultralight\r\n  tube, I'll save 103g per wheel.  But I'm not about to spend $14 on a\r\n  tube.  (I only have one at all\r\n  for <a href=\"archive/2571#historical_reasons\">historical reasons</a>.)  So I'll\r\n  give the regular 26'' tubes a shot and save 46g per wheel.  But if I\r\n  end up flatting all the time because I'm riding thinner tubes, I'll\r\n  be back to the 29s pronto.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> All together, my bike got 251g lighter today.  Doesn't sound like\r\n  much, but that's half a pound.  Not too shabby.\r\n</p>\r\n",
    "body": "<p> <a name=\"historical_reasons\">Footnote: My Tube Replacement Algorithm</a>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> When I get a flat, SOP is to first find &amp; patch the puncture,\r\n  then replace the tube only if the patch doesn't hold.  This almost\r\n  always gets me home riding the same tubes I started with.  But\r\n  patches don't last.  So once I've patched a tube a couple of times,\r\n  I give it one or two more rides, then replace it, even if it isn't\r\n  yet leaking.  The net result is that when I replace the tubes on my\r\n  bike, I can usually use the cheap, slightly heavier ones, and do the\r\n  tube replacement in the comfort of my garage instead of on the\r\n  trail.  So why have a fancy super-light tube at all?  Because it's\r\n  the extra, emergency tube I carry in my pack on every ride.  I'm\r\n  probably going to carry that spare tube for a long while before I\r\n  actually use it, so investing in a lighter spare tube is actually a\r\n  better use of my money than investing in the tubes I'm riding on.\r\n  The tubes I ride don't last more than a couple of months, but the\r\n  fancy Ultralight tube lasted over a year in my pack.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

I was\r\naiming to do a <a href=\"maps/20090720-wildwood.gpx\">short loop</a>, up\r\nthe Lower Butte trail to the cross, then back along the Santa Rosa\r\ntrail.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Immediately, I realized that I'd set my seat based on what I'm\r\nused to on my road bike.  And I'd chosen to leave the fork just as it\r\narrived-- the sag was about right, and I generally like to at least\r\ntry the defaults before I start tweaking.  The result was that my\r\nfront end felt <em>very</em> mushy.  I'm going to bump up the\r\npressure, get the sag to about 20 mm (it's a 100 mm travel fork), and\r\nup the damping a little bit.  That should get me to a place where I\r\ncan make small adjustments and really dial it in.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I'm also looking around for a set of eggbeater pedals at a decent\r\nprice.  The Times I have on at the moment came with my old bike, but\r\nI'm very aware of why I replaced them: they're heavy, and not very\r\neasy to clip in to.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> It's too early to say anything about switching to a 29er.  Right\r\nnow, I'm feeling everything as simply <em>different</em>, rather than\r\nbetter or worse.  Gotta say, though-- so, so smooth on the flats.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> But the real reason I can't say anything about the bike: me.  A\r\nwise man once said that the overwhelming factor in the performance of\r\nthe bike is <em>the rider</em>.  And I am very out of shape.  Can't\r\nhold my line.  Can't stay in the saddle through technical sections,\r\ncan't maintain torque and balance and let the bike flow.  I'm just not\r\nas good as I was.  And I was never that good to begin with.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> And if I'm out of shape, there's only one reasonable solution:\r\nride more!  So I'm headed out again later this week, with a lower\r\nseat, a stiffer fork, and (maybe) stronger legs.\r\n</p>\r\n",

There's an official kiosk at the\r\ntrailhead, but after that, you're kind of on your own.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I <a href=\"maps/20110702-mystery-stagecoach-loop.gpx\">hiked a nice loop through the area a while back</a>, and last night\r\nreturned with my running shoes.  I'd originally planned to follow the\r\npath of my hike, but about a mile in, it was clear that the loop was\r\nfar, far shorter than I remembered.  So I extended it a little, and\r\nafter pushing down an overgrown trail (and avoiding a tarantula that\r\nwandered past) I found my way toward the Santa Susana Pass Rd. onto a\r\ntrail that looped back exactly where I needed to go.

I headed for Point Mugu State Park to\r\nhike up to the top of Boney Peak.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I loaded up my iPhone with trail maps (just for geeky fun), and\r\nheaded out from the trailhead off Wendy Drive.  The plan was to take\r\nthe Satwiwa Loop trail to Danielson Fire Rd, then up to the Old Cabin\r\nSite, and take the Upper Cabin Trail to Boney Peak.  From there, I'd\r\nhead down via the Ridge Trail, which eventually reconnects with the\r\nOld Boney Trail, which would take me back to the Upper Cabin Trail,\r\nand home again.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Everything was going great until I headed down along the <a href=\"http://venturacountytrails.org/TrailMaps/Sycamore/AreaTrails.htm#WesternRidgeTrail\">Ridge\r\nTrail</a>.  I'd met some hikers on the way up Upper Cabin who said that\r\nthe Ridge Trail was really hard to follow, but that they'd \"seen\r\npeople disappear down that way, and then met them later down in the\r\nvalley.\"  No problem!  I have GPS!  (&lt;-- Idiot.)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <a href=\"http://venturacountytrails.org/TrailMaps/Sycamore/AreaTrails.htm#WesternRidgeTrail\">Ventura\r\nCounty Trails.org</a> lists this trail as a \"double black diamond\",\r\nbut says that it's a \"tough hike but the incredible views and the\r\nsatisfaction of overcoming the challenges make it all worthwhile.\"\r\nAnd that once you're on the trail, the way is fairly obvious.  I say\r\nthat the Ridge Trail is not a \"trail.\"  It is a horrible, unmaintained\r\nscramble along the roughest terrain in the park.  Even with GPS, it is\r\nexceptionally easy to wander off-course, and I had to backtrack several\r\ntimes to re-locate the trail.  I <em>strongly</em> recommend that\r\nnobody hike this trail, ever.

    "intro": "<p> Getting paid every other Friday <em>sucks</em>.  You're not likely to notice the suckage when you're flush with cash, but when finances are tight, it really, really sucks.  \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I've had several conversations with friends and family who don't see why.  After all, if you're making $12k a year, then who cares whether you're getting $500 twice a month, or $461.50 every other Friday?  And you're getting paid <em>sooner</em>, which must be <em>better</em>, right?\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Wrong.  My experience with biweekly paychecks is that I constantly felt like I was falling farther and farther behind, with reprieves at the end of June and December.  Nobody believed me, so I made a spreadsheet to illustrate the point.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> The red line is your bank balance if you're making $1020 each month, and spending $1000 on the first of each month.  The blue line is your bank balance if you're making $471 every two weeks (still $1020 per month), and spending the same $1000 per month.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Lo and behold, look at the red (bi-monthly pay) line's steadily climbing peaks and valleys.  Every month, like clockwork, you get a little farther ahead.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> And look at that blue line, steadily dropping from January until June, when you get three paychecks and end up back on top.  And at that point, you start the descent again.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> And note that if you're being paid bi-weekly, whatever high points you hit are illusions-- you'd better save that cash for a rainy day, because six months from now, you're going to be behind the 8-ball once again.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> This also explains two things about how I run my finances:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> First, when I calculate my monthly income (when making a budget, for instance), I don't take my yearly salary and divide by 12.  I take one paycheck, and double it.  That's how much I can rely on to come in every month.  This way, I know I can cover all my bills, regardless of whether I'm in the hights of July or January, or the depths of June or December.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> This has the side-effect of forcing me to live <em>well</em> beneath my means.  About 15% of my income is <em>ignored</em> when calculating my monthly budget.  This is by necessity: if I lived close to my means, those downward-marching spikes on the blue line would bite into me pretty hard.  As long as I have spare cash around, I don't have to worry.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Second, dropping below about $500 in my checking account stresses me out <em>huge</em>.  Why?  Because after years of being paid bi-weekly, I know I need that padding.  I have to check the calendar to know when my next paycheck is coming, and figure out whether I have enough in that account to cover my bills.  It's not as simple as \"What's today's date?\"  Rather, I have to know the current date, the date that I get paid next, and the date that the bill is due.  I've learned the hard way to keep that $500 \"safety net\" in the account, lest I end up overdrawn when a bill comes due on the first, and my paycheck arrives on the second.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I did some tinkering with the numbers.  The graph above is for montly expenses of $1000 against an average monthly income of $1020.  If you're getting paid bi-weekly, and want to save $20 every month, you have to reduce your expenses to about $922, nearly 8%.  This means that you'll see big jumps twice a year when you get an \"extra\" paycheck.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Really, this is meant to illustrate the radical difference a simple scheduling difference can make.  It means that in order to achieve basic goals like saving money each month, or to be able to recover from a large but unavoidable expense (car, illness, previous layoff), you have to markedly reduce your monthly expenses from what you could support if you were simply paid on the 15th and 30th.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Think about that stretch from April 15th to July 1st.  You've spent your money paying your taxes, and it's only going to get worse until July.\r\n</p>",

    "intro": "<p> I've been on something of a mission to elevate my game lately, and\r\nemail handling is absolutely core to that.  Most of the people I deal\r\nwith daily know me <em>only</em> via email, so appearing responsive\r\nand helpful is key.  I've written a bit of Applescript to help with this.\r\n</p>\r\n",
    "body": "<p> My goals are to read every email within 10 minutes of receiving\r\nit, and do <em>something</em> with it within 20 minutes of receiving\r\nit.  I don't have to answer it, but I've got to get it out of my\r\ninbox.  For me, that means one of three things:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n  <li> Answer it. </li>\r\n  <li> Archive it. </li>\r\n  <li> Turn it into a task in <a href=\"archive/2477\">Things</a>. </li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p> The key here is that I want to avoid jumping on every email <em>as\r\nit arrives</em>, or even getting notified as it arrives.  I want a\r\nsystem that interrupts me less, but helps me stay responsive.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I <em>could</em> do something like check my email at the top of\r\nevery hour.  Or every 30 min.  But what if I don't get any email in\r\nthat 30 min?  I'm interrupting myself for nothing.  And if someone\r\nemails me just after I've finished processing email, they could wait\r\nanother 25 minutes before I've even read their note, let alone\r\nresponded, so I'm interrupting myself unnecessarily, and not meeting\r\nmy goal of responding within 20 min.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Really, what I want is a notification that lets me know that\r\nthere's email waiting, and that it's been there a while, and I should\r\nprobably go have a look and do something with it.  So, being a\r\nprogrammer, that's what I built.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> It's an Applescript, and I call it email-notify-languishing.scpt.\r\nIt just lets me know whenever there's an unread message older than 10\r\nminutes, or any message older than 20 minutes that I haven't replied\r\nto.  So far it's working great.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Previously, I was notified of every email that came in, so I'd be\r\ninterrupted 40 to 50 times a day.  Even if I'm getting an email every\r\nminute, the new system will interrupt me at most once every 10\r\nminutes, so 48 times in a typical work day.  And I suspect it will\r\nbe <em>much</em> less than that.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> And I can certainly monkey with the numbers.  If my \"read within\r\n10, respond within 20\" rule interrupts me 12 times a day, but dropping\r\nto 15/20 means I only get interrupted 8 times a day, with the same\r\naverage response time?  That's a win.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> So the metrics for success are:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li> How often do I interrupt what I'm doing to process email?  (Lower is better.)\r\n  <li> How long does it typically take me to respond? (Lower is better.)\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p> And I suspect that I'll win a few things for free.  I now have a\r\nstandard email policy.  So when someone says, \"You've been a little\r\nlaggy on email this week,\" I can respond with, \"I read all email\r\nwithin 10 minutes of receiving it, and give <em>some</em> kind of\r\nanswer, where appropriate, within 20.  If I promise to respond within\r\n15 minutes, will that work?\"  In other words, the conversation stops\r\nbeing about perception, and starts being about reality, which\r\nis <em>excellent</em> for calming nerves and restoring sanity.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> And I've thought about getting fancy.  For instance, I could alter\r\nthe script so that if an incoming message is a reply to something I\r\nsent, I can make sure to reply faster than the sender did.  (In other\r\nwords: \"Judy replied to my email within 8 minutes.  Make sure I reply\r\nto her within 7 minutes.  Joe took two hours to reply, so if I reply\r\nto him within 30 minutes, that's fine.\")\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> We shall see.  For now, just establishing some baseline metrics is\r\nthe big win.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> To be continued...\r\n</p>\r\n"

Prof. Pausch\r\ntalks about the clarity to know what really matters, and the\r\nconviction to <em>shove everything else off the boat</em>.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Establishing priorities is about some things that are really hard.\r\nIt's about recognizing that there are some things you're <em>not</em>\r\ngoing to do in order to accomplish something else, and often those\r\nother things are hard to let go of.  (To-do list and schedules help\r\nwith this-- it's far less painful to give up my trail run tonight if I\r\nknow I can make time for it tomorrow.)  It's about acknowledging that\r\nwe're human, and that we can't do it all, and that not doing it all\r\ndoesn't make us lazy.

    "intro": "<p> Rosanne Barr was never one of my heros.  I heard stories of her\r\nbeing insane, and while my family tuned in every week to see what the\r\nConnors were up to, there were plenty of nights where <i>Roseanne</i>\r\nwas a little too real. John Goodman was a little too scary, the kids\r\njust a little too far gone, the whole situation just too desperate for\r\nus.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Anyway, I'm thinking about this because Roseanne Barr has written\r\na piece in New York Magazine called <a\r\nhref=\"http://nymag.com/print/?/arts/tv/upfronts/2011/roseanne-barr-2011-5/\">And\r\nI Should Know</a>.  It details her fight to make <i>Roseanne</i> about\r\nreal families, with real lives.  There are always three sides to every\r\nstory, but it certainly sheds light on why nobody in Hollywood\r\nunderstood Roseanne Barr.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I think I need to give the series another look.  When it first\r\naired, (1988) I was 12, and my sister was 9, and a lot of\r\n<i>Roseanne</i> was lost on us.  But some scenes have stuck with me,\r\nand now resonate in a way that only the best drama does. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I suspect\r\nthat, like <i>The Daily Show</i>, <i>Roseanne</i> wasn't just comedy,\r\nit was comedy <em>about</em> something.  And the entire run is on\r\nNetflix's streaming service.  I wouldn't be surprised if Roseanne (Conner <em>and</em> Barr) comes out looking pretty heroic.\r\n<p>\r\n",

I need rules that can do more\r\nthan tell me I just got a new email, or file it for me.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I'd like to start with a rule that lets me know when a message has\r\nbeen sitting unread in my inbox for more than 10 minutes.

The word \"Sat\" means\r\n      being. \"Chit\" means consciousness. \"Ananda\" means bliss or\r\n      rapture. I thought, \"I don't know whether my consciousness is\r\n      proper consciousness or not; I don't know whether what I know of\r\n      my being is my proper being or not; but I do know where my rapture\r\n      is. So let me hang on to rapture, and that will bring me both my\r\n      consciousness and my being.\" I think it worked.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </blockquote>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p> I've heard a variation on this: \"You can't think your way to right\r\naction, but you can act your way to right thought.\"  Restated: \"Act as\r\nif you have faith, and faith shall be given to you.\"  Restated again:\r\n\"Fake it 'til you make it.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> And that nicely parallels some of the things\r\nthat <a href=\"http://being.publicradio.org/programs/2011/yoga/transcript.shtml\">Sean\r\nCorn said on <i>On Being</i></a> about integrating physical action\r\nwith prayer, and that through Yoga she reached a spiritual awakening\r\nthat eluded her.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> And that brings me back to something I've had to internalize in my\r\nefforts to improve my work life: I can't overhaul the whole system at\r\nonce.  I have to do the next thing, and then the next thing, and be\r\ngentle and mindful at each step.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Which of course brings me all the way back to Merlin Mann,\r\nyelling: \"What can't you ship?\"\r\n</p>\r\n",

It\r\nhas <i>radically</i> improved my task management at work and at home.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> To that, I've now added a little timer app\r\ncalled <a href=\"http://www.celmaro.com/minco/\">Minco</a>.  Minco runs\r\nin the background, keeping track of how much time I spend on each\r\ntask.  I pull up Minco, pick a task, start the timer, and get to work.\r\nWhen I'm done, I pull up Minco again, hit Cmd-., and Minco marks that\r\ntask as complete.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> But here's the best part: Minco integrates with iCal.  And Things\r\nintegrates with iCal.  So now, when I enter a task in my \"Today\" list\r\nin Things, it shows up in Minco, and I can track how long it takse me\r\nto complete.  And at the end of my day, I have a complete record of\r\nhow I spent my time.  Pretty bitchin'.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> But the question, of course, is: \"Why?\"  Why bother tracking how\r\nlong it takes to do something?\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Because, as a wise man once told me, \"If you don't measure it, you\r\ncan't manage it.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I used to think that \"cycling computers\" were kind of silly.  Who\r\ncares how fast you were pedaling?  But when I got a GPS unit to map my\r\nmountain bike rides, I noticed that shifting <em>down</em> a gear\r\nfrequently made me go <em>faster</em>.  My pedal cadence went up, my\r\npower output went up, my speed went up, and my heart rate\r\nwent <em>down</em>.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> After the amazing (to me, anyway) success I've had with tools\r\nlike <a href=\"http://www.mint.com\">Mint</a>\r\nand <a href=\"http://culturedcode.com/things/\">Things</a>, I'm only too\r\neager to start tracking how I really spend my time, and see what that\r\ndata teaches me.\r\n</p>",

    "intro": "<p> I made a wrong turn onto Mulholand Highway, and it took the\r\nsemi-busted GPS on my iPhone a few seconds to catch up.  On the radio, NPR informed me that several hikers\r\nhad to be rescued from (wait for\r\nit) <a href=\"http://www.vcstar.com/news/2011/feb/20/hikers-rescued-in-santa-barbara-mountains/\">blizzard-like\r\nconditions near Santa Barbara</a>.  And here I was headed for the\r\nhighest peak in the Santa Monica Mountains.  \"This doesn't\r\nbode well,\" I told Henri.  She stuck her nose out the window, sniffing the breeze.\r\n</p>\r\n",
    "body": "<p> Happily, I was packed for just about anything.  I wore heavy\r\nhiking boots, wool socks, and soft shell pants and jacket over thin\r\nbase layers.  And because the weather has been pretty freaky lately\r\n(for southern California), I carried waterproof pants and jacket and a\r\ndown vest in my backpack.  And at the last minute I'd remembered to\r\ngrab a wool beanie.  I felt I'd be fine, but if the\r\nweather <em>really</em> turned, I'd be carrying Henri home curled up\r\nin my jacket.  (Note to self: Henri needs Gore-Tex.)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I got out of the car and took a look around.  Fast-moving cumulus\r\n  clouds, strong wind, and temps around 50&deg or so.  Chilly.  My\r\n  thin jacket wasn't really doing much to keep me warm, but I figured\r\n  I'd be generating my own heat once I hit the trail.  Just the same,\r\n  I pulled on my wool beanie, glad to have at least <em>something</em>\r\n  fuzzy to put on.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I was right on the money.  After about ten minutes, I opened the\r\nfront zip on my jacket.  Five minutes after that, I didn't need my\r\nbeanie.  And five minutes after <em>that</em>, I stopped to take off\r\nmy jacket entirely.  And Henri was doing great.  She was a little\r\nskeptical at first, but she was amped to be outside and hiking, and\r\nher enthusiasm won out.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> The Mishe Mokwa/Backbone loop is a local classic for good reason.\r\n Constantly changing microclimates, plenty of twists and turns to keep\r\n you interested, and 360&deg; vistas from both Inspiration Point and\r\n Sandstone Peak.  It was a little muddy today, but in a few weeks\r\n it'll be dry, green, and flowering.  If you live anywhere from\r\n Ventura to Santa Monica, go.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Henri was a trooper, scrambling up steep rock to reach Inspiration\r\nPoint and Sandstone Peak.  And though she usually hates getting her\r\nfeet wet, she waded a stream with just a moment's hesitation.  I\r\nleaned down to carry her across, and she just stepped right through.\r\nThat's my girl!\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n"

    "intro": "<p> At Merlin Mann's behest, I finally got around to reading Marc\r\nHedlund's post on why Wesabe, the company he co-founded to help people\r\nbetter manage their money, failed.  It is absolutely worth reading\r\njust for his analysis.  But he touched on a tangential point that\r\nreally struck me:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n  <p> I think in this case, Mint totally won at the first (making\r\n    users happy quickly), and we both [Mint and Wesabe] totally failed\r\n    at the second (actually helping people).  No one, in my view,\r\n    solved the financial problems of consumers.  No one even got\r\n    close.  Yes, both products helped some people -- ours mostly\r\n    through a supportive community and theirs mostly through giving\r\n    people a rough picture of where their money has gone. But when we\r\n    analyzed the benefits we saw for our users, and when Mint boasted\r\n    about the benefits they saw for their users, the debt reduction\r\n    and savings increase numbers directly matched the national\r\n    averages.\r\n  </p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p> Read that again: Mint and Wesabe users exactly matched the\r\nnational average in debt reduction and savings increase.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I think Marc does himself a disservice here.  People who are\r\nfinancially healthy don't seek out new financial tools.  People (like\r\nme) who need real help getting a grip on their finances do.  For us,\r\nbecoming financially average is a <em>huge step forward</em>.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> And I think that there are hard external limits on just how much\r\nprogress can be made by these people (again, people like me, lest I\r\nsound aloof) that make it harder to do much better than average over\r\njust a year or two.  I'd <em>love</em> to switch to lower-interest\r\ncredit cards, but I can't get them yet.  My credit rating is too low\r\nand my revolving debt is too high.  So I have to spend a year or two\r\npaying down my debt and raising my credit score before I can make the\r\nnext really effective change.  So I honestly think that Mint does (and\r\nWesabe would have) really help a lot of people.  Hedlund just doesn't\r\nhave data over a long enough time period.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I think that in the long term, the financial health of Mint's\r\nusers will follow a stair step pattern as users make what changes they\r\ncan, then wait while benefits accumulate, then make the next round of\r\nchanges.\r\n</p>\r\n",

(I've been ceding most of my commute time to Merlin\r\nMann and Dan Benjamin.)  If they prove worthwhile, I'll add them to\r\nthe list.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n",

Specifically, I want:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li> steadily decreasing debt load\r\n  <li> all my bills paid on time, automatically\r\n  <li> save a portion of every paycheck\r\n  <li> save up for big purchases (bike, new phone, vacation...)\r\n  <li> know how much I can spend guilt-free\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p> I haven't mastered <em>all</em> of that, but I'm on the way.  A\r\nfew key techniques have worked really well.\r\n</p>",
    "body": "\r\n\r\n<p> I've used <a href=\"http://www.mint.com\">Mint.com</a> to track my\r\nmonthly spending.  As a coleague once said, \"If you don't measure it,\r\nyou can't manage it.\"  Mint.com answers the monthly question, \"Ack!\r\nWhere'd all my money go?!\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I've automated all my bill payments and savings deposits, and all\r\nthat automation is configured at <em>my bank</em>, not through various\r\nvendors' billing departments.  Every paycheck gets automatically\r\ndivided up and dispersed, and I'm always completely clear on how much\r\nI have to spend.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I've\r\ncreated <a href=\"http://www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com/blog/tip-using-sub-savings-accounts-for-unexpected-expenses/\">sub-savings\r\naccounts</a> to save up for big items, and I deposit a few dollars\r\nfrom every paycheck.  I find it very easy to be patient when I know\r\nexactly how long I'll have to wait.  (And it's nice to know that about\r\nthe time that Apple's big announcements come around in June, my\r\n\"iPhone Fund\" will have $200 in it.)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I'm really bad at keeping mental account of what I've spent in a\r\nday.  So my bank sends me an email when my available balance gets low.\r\nThis lets me move money or delay spending to avoid problems.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I manage my to-do lists using an iPhone and Apple OS X application\r\ncalled <a href=\"http://culturedcode.com/things/\">Things</a>. I've <a href=\"archive/2445\">written\r\nabout <i>Things</i> before</a>, so I won't go into details here.  It\r\nsuffices to say that <i>Things</i> is so awesome for day-to-day usage\r\nthat I've completely abandoned paper.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I got a $20 Starbucks gift card for myself, registered it through\r\ntheir website, and I refill it on the first of every month.  This does\r\na couple of things.  First, when the card runs out, that's my cue to\r\nstop going to Starbucks for the rest of the month.  Now, I've actually\r\nnever just stopped going.  But having $0 left on the card triggers a\r\nlittle guilt about going over-budget, which helps me be good.  I've\r\nseen a <em>radical</em> reduction in spending on coffee this year.\r\nAnd second, I've reached the \"gold\" level of Starbucks's rewards\r\nprogram, and now get few perks that take a bit of the financial sting\r\nout of my coffee habit.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Modest stuff, I know.  But effective.  Bottom line: it eliminates\r\nbusywork, procrastination, and forgetfulness, makes good behavior the\r\ndefault, and provides daily positive reinforcement.  I'm\r\na <em>much</em> happier guy when I'm not worried about money.\r\n</p>\r\n"

He said that the best way to\r\nmanage your online passwords\r\nis <a href=\"http://openid.net/\">OpenID</a>.  It's a way for websites\r\nto be sure you're you, but let OpenID.org handle security.  \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> But here's the thing: regular users don't like using OpenID.\r\nYishan Wong hits it right on the head in his blog\r\npost <a href=\"http://www.quora.com/What-s-wrong-with-OpenID\">What's\r\nWrong with OpenID?</a>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n  <p> The short answer is that OpenID is the worst possible \"solution\" I\r\n  have ever seen in my entire life to a problem that most people don't\r\n  really have.  That's what's \"wrong\" with it.\r\n  </p>\r\n\r\n  <p> ...\r\n  </p>\r\n\r\n  <p> A nerd will wrinkle up his nose at these solutions [to managing\r\n  multiple accounts] and grumble about the \"security vulnerabilities\"\r\n  (and they'll be right, technically) but the truth is that these\r\n  solutions get people into the site and doing what they want and no\r\n  one really cares about security anyways.\r\n  </p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p> And he's right.  Getting regular, non-geek folks to create and use\r\nOpenID accounts is a non-starter.  It's extra work (they have to learn\r\nabout what OpenID is, and then figure out how to use it), and there's\r\nno perceived reason to do that extra work (they don't care about\r\nsecurity, and they don't want to take responsibility for managing\r\ntheir online security).\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> It's a classic case of balancing trade-offs over time.  Learning\r\nabout, setting up, and using an OpenID account pays off some time in\r\nthe future, and only if on of your accounts gets hacked.  <em>Not</em>\r\nsetting up an OpenID account pays off immediately, and for sure.  \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> As humans, we're biologically incapable of making the right call\r\nhere.  Howard Hunreuther and Robert Meyer of the Philadelphia school's\r\nRisk Management and Descision Process Center created\r\na <a href=\"http://incaseofemergencyblog.com/2010/06/04/whartons-quake-simulation-game-shows-why-humans-do-such-a-poor-job-planning-for-learning-from-catastrophes/\">game\r\nsimulating earthquake preparedness</a>.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> The game was simple: players had a house, and a bank account.\r\nWhoever finished the game with the highest net worth won.  Players\r\ncould spend money to protect their house from quakes, or leave it in\r\nthe bank and collect interest.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> No matter what the researchers did, every student ended up\r\ndestroying their house.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Why?  Because it was just too tempting to leave the money in the\r\nbank.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n\"They think, 'Can I get away with the next 30 seconds in the game?'\"\r\nsays Meyer. \"'What are the odds of getting destroyed in the next 30\r\nseconds? Well, probably very little.' So they think, 'OK, I'll go a\r\nminute.' And of course eventually they get destroyed.\"\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p> So, everyone's right.  OpenID <em>is</em> better than sprinkling\r\nyour passwords all over the net.  Users will <em>never</em> go for\r\nit.   \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> So it's up to individual web sites to force the issue.  It would\r\nbe great for <em>everyone</em> if everyone used OpenID accounts to log\r\nin everywhere.  But <em>every individual user and website has good\r\nreason not to make this change</em>.  Users don't like the extra work\r\nand don't care about the benefits, because they're too nebulous.  And\r\nwebsites just want more users, so they go with what the users want.\r\nClassic <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons\">Tragedy\r\nof the Commons</a>.  If we could all get together and do the right\r\nthing as a group, we'd all win.  But we can't.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> So we're trapped by human nature and economics.  Which is really\r\nwhat I see as interesting about the online world: it is rapidly and\r\nstarkly revealing the limits of human rationality.\r\n</p>"

I sat for a minute and weighed the whole rain / temperature / sweat balance.  Finally, I shrugged and stepped out of the car.  Either way, I'd probably learn something.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> 90 minutes later, I had learned.  The soft shell pants and jacket would have been great if I'd stayed on trail.  But I did a <em>lot</em> of scrambling and bushwhacking, and I was soaked.  \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> As soon as I hit the turn-around point at the top of Hummingbird, thick fog had rolled in, the rain was coming down, and I was cold.  I found a sheltered spot and swapped my soaked-through soft shell for a vest, hard shell, and wool beanie.  The difference was dramatic. It was like coming inside out of the rain.  I felt completely sheltered.  I snugged down my hood and headed for home.  \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> So, the plan for next time: if it's raining any more than a drizzle, the cap 2 and hard shell are the way to go.  My soft shell pants stood up beautifully, but if I'm going to do as much off-trail exploring as I did today, I'll wear hard shell pants as well.  \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> And my boots totally failed at being waterproof.  Which is expected; they're about 5 years old now.  My feet were swimming by the time I got back to the car.   I might try doing a waterproofing treatment, but at this point I think they're overkill for most of the hiking I do.  Time to get something lighter, but still waterproof.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Unexpected awesome: my new rain shell (pictured) features an elastic drawstring  that snugs down the hood.  Kind of a built-in headband.  It is <em>awesome</em>.  It's one of those features that looks a bit odd on the rack, and doesn't seem all that vital.  But with a wool beanie on and the hood up, I had perfect weather protection that stayed put.  No more wearing soaking wet baseball caps!  Hooray!\r\n</p>",

    "intro": "<p> I got in a lot of trouble for being \"disorganized\" in grade\r\nschool.  Partly it was because many of my teachers were less than\r\n\"organized\" themselves, partly because I was, y'know, <em>12</em>, and\r\npartly because nobody every showed me how to really do this.  (Though\r\nI recall my mom and dad going to great lengths to show me what worked\r\nfor them.)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Looking back, I realize that the people who couldn't understand\r\nwhy I was having a tough time all had homes and cars and desks and\r\nproper day planners.  They had all the tools and space necessary to\r\n\"get organized\".  It's somewhat harder when all your \"get organized\"\r\ngear has to fit in one kid-sized backpack and a locker the size of a\r\nhotel microwave.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>What's in it for me?</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> There were a few things that I didn't realize would happen when I\r\nstarted getting my act together.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> First, I'd do more, be better at what I did, and have <em>more\r\ntime to myself</em> once everyone got off my case.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Also, never underestimate the persuasive power you have when you\r\ncan <em>show</em> people what you're working on.  Plenty of teachers\r\nlove to move deadlines.  If you can show them in writing that you're\r\nalready fully booked for the next week <em>without</em> adding their\r\npaper, you'll be able to fight back much more effectively.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I'd enjoy my classes a lot more when I knew I was on top of\r\neverything.  Procrastination is a downward spiral of stress, bad\r\ngrades, un-fun assignments, late nights finishing papers at the last\r\nminute, and always knowing that there's some assignment you should be\r\nworking on.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Here's the biggest idea here: This is not a system built to\r\nmaximize your use of every second of every day and turn you into a\r\nrobot.  You can do that if you want, but that's not the goal here.\r\nThe real goal is to give you <em>control</em>.  If you know what needs\r\nto be done and when you're going to do it, you also know when you\r\ncan <em>stop for the day</em>.  \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n",
    "body": "<p> <b>Supplies</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Here's what you need to get through school after about the second\r\ngrade:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> You need the general supplies.  Pens, pencils, pencil sharpener,\r\ncalculator, sharpie, protractor, compass, plus all the stuff for\r\nspecialized classes like art and music.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> In addition to this, you will need one small (1'' rings)\r\nthree-ring binder with nothing but blank notebook paper.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> For <em>each class</em>, you will need a <em>small (1''\r\nrings)</em> three-ring binder, divided into sections:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n  <li> Completed Assignents to be turned in.\r\n  <li> Assignments in progress (this includes hand-outs, instruction sheets, etc.)\r\n  <li> Today's notes.\r\n  <li> Past notes.\r\n  <li> Assignments that have been graded and returned.\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p> And you may need a second notebook to hold returned assignments.\r\n(See below.)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> So, if you have six classes, you'll need a total of seven\r\nnotebooks (one for each class, plus one with blank paper).\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> And at home, you'll need a file cabinet.  A real, adult-style\r\nhanging file folder cabinet.  It's the only sane way to keep track of\r\npaper.  Organize this any way you like, but do have one and keep it\r\norganized.  I suggest a structure that mirrors the three-ring binders\r\nyou use for class.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> In addition, you'll need a proper day planner.  I like my\r\nMoleskine daily planner, but use whatever works for you.  (If you want\r\nto use <i>Things</i> on your iPod Touch, go for it.)  The important\r\nthing here is that you be able to write down when assignments are due,\r\nand when you plan to work on them.  So each assignment actually\r\ngets <em>two</em> entries in the book.  If you have math homework\r\nthat's due on Friday, and a spelling test on Friday, then Thursday's\r\npage in your planner looks like this:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Thursday</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li> study for spelling test\r\n  <li> math homework: Page 134, numbers 2-30 (even numbered propblems only)\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p> And Friday's page looks like this:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Friday</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li> spelling test!\r\n  <li> turn in math homework\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p> There are a couple of key ideas in play here.  Primarily this\r\nsystem provides a place for everything.  No more stuffing everything\r\nin the front pocket of your binder.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Use three-ring binder paper <em>only</em>.  The paper for a\r\ntypical assignment starts in the binder for blank paper, moves to the\r\n\"completed assignments\" section, gets turned in, and then put into the\r\n\"graded assignments\" section in your class notebook.  You just can't\r\ndo that with spiral-bound paper.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Then there are practical considerations.  If you have homework in\r\nmath, history, English, and science, that probably means you'll have\r\nto carry all four binders <em>and</em> four textbooks home from\r\nschool.  This is why it's important to get three-ring binders with\r\nsmall rings.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> If necessary, offload returned assignments from your main class\r\nbinder into a second binder, or into your file cabinet at home.  \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> There are two strong reasons to keep old assignments.  First,\r\nteachers love to play \"Gotcha!\" with old assignemts.  They love to\r\nmake you keep them and turn them in again as \"notebooks\" or\r\n\"portfolios\".  This is total bullshit, but they love it.  So stay\r\nahead of that game.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> The other reason to keep old assignments: questions from past\r\nassignments tend to appear on tests.  So if you know what's on the\r\nassignments, you know what to concentrate on when you're studying, and\r\nyou'll probably do well on the test.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Conculsions</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> With six or seven classes, sports, band, chores, friends, and\r\nhobbies, the organizational challenges of getting through school\r\nare <em>non-trivial</em>, yet almost no effort is ever made in school\r\nto teach kids how to manage their time or organize their work.  Those\r\nstudents who figure it out on their own get A's without trying.  My\r\nsystem of binders came from a Geometry teacher I had in summer school.\r\nI've tried to look her up, but I only ever knew her as \"Miss\r\nModzeleski\", and I'd bet that's now simply her maiden name.  She gets\r\nhuge credit for organizing her lessons just as neatly as she taught us\r\nto organize our work.  I used her system from then on.  \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n"

    "intro": "<p> Over the last couple of days, I've been having a bit of a\r\n  freakout.  Work on the house <em>feels</em> like it's ground to a\r\n  halt.  It <em>feels</em> like there's too much to do and we'll never\r\n  get it done and I'll be tripping over plastic and Henri will be\r\n  waking me up four times a night <em>forever</em>.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> But that's obviously not the case.  The yard improved by leaps and\r\n  bounds this week, thanks to Janell's work in laying out (and staking\r\n  down) Henri's area, and my dad's tireless, lonely efforts in breaking\r\n  up the hard-packed soil in our back yard and making it fit to lay sod\r\n  over.  So what things <em>feel</em> like in my stressed-out,\r\n  overwhelmed moments in no way reflects reality.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I've made a few \"to-do\" lists for the house lately, and they\r\n  always make me feel worse, not better.  They're just a formless\r\n  cataloging of everything that's making me crazy.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> What I really needed was a dependency chart.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> So I took a few minutes and started with\r\n  the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs\">big\r\n    things</a> (time with Janell, food, sleep, exercise, recreation) and\r\n  worked my way through what was preventing me from getting these\r\n  things.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> As expected, there are some vicious cycles at work.  Henri has to\r\n  go to doggy day camp during the day because the yard isn't safe for\r\n  her.  But I can't fix the yard, because I'm spending all my time and\r\n  money taking Henri to camp.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> But when viewed in graph form, the bottlenecks are obvious.  And\r\n  they're not at all where I thought.  There are two or three small\r\n  things that will help un-jam the entire process.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> So this weekend, I have two priorities:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<dl>\r\n  <dt> <b>Finish the tile repair in the kitchen and install the stove.</b>\r\n  </dt>\r\n  <dd> This will radically un-clutter the kitchen, and will let us do\r\n    proper cooking at home.  This in turn will save us huge amounts of\r\n    time and money that we now spend eating out.\r\n  </dd>\r\n\r\n  <dt> <b>Install wire screens on the gates to the back yard.</b>\r\n  </dt>\r\n  <dd> This will make it possible for Henri to stay home during the\r\n    day, which will let me spend about an hour less each day commuting,\r\n    and save enough money over the next month to pay for new sod.\r\n  </dd>\r\n</dl>\r\n\r\n<p> See, I <em>thought</em> that things like finishing the guest\r\n  rooms, or painting the doors in the house so I can put the doorknobs\r\n  back on, or any number of the tiny things that drive me crazy every\r\n  day.  But what's really going to make my life better is two simple,\r\n  cheap repairs that will un-clog the whole system, and remove the\r\n  vicious cycles from my dependency graph.  I'm not going to focus on\r\n  the things that cause me stress every day.  Instead, I'm going to\r\n  focus on those tasks that will free up the time and money I need to\r\n  make other improvements.\r\n</p>\r\n",

    "intro": "<p> This may not <em>look</em> like much, but it's a major milestone.  When we moved in, there was a concrete foundation (of sorts) here, that once supported an illegal, non-permitted guest room complete with running water, electricity, and even a cable TV connection.  Last weekend, thinking I could dispose of the cinder block and concrete footing myself, I bought a 10 lb. sledge hammer, and went to work.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I will say that swinging a sledge hammer in anger is really, really fun.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> But the hammer wasn't enough to crack the concrete.  So I rented a 25 lb. jackhammer, and went to work with that.  But after about two hours, it was very clear that either the hammer was underpowered, I didn't know what I was doing, or both.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I took the jackhammer back to Home Depot, told the guy there what I was trying to do, and asked what <em>he</em> would use. \"I'd use a 90 lb. pneumatic,\" he said.  \"But we don't rent those.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Fortunately, we're already having some work done on the house, so I asked the contractor if he could have the concrete removed.  He quoted a reasonable price, and a couple days later, a professional went to work with, you guessed it, a 90 lb. pneumatic jackhammer, which cut the concrete with aplomb.  \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Once the rubble was cleared it was my turn to come back in and rake away the last of the concrete fragments, and fill the hole with 15 bags of topsoil.  Each back weighs about 80 lbs, and has to be lifted at least five times: once onto the cart at Home Depot, once into the car, once into the wheel barrow, once <em>out</em> of the wheel barrow, and finally into place where I could cut open the bag and empty it into the hole.  That's a lot of lifting, in awkward positions, using my back exactly the way a personal trainer would tell me not to.  But there's only one way to get a heavy item out of your trunk: bend over and lift it out.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Long story short (too late), I've put in two solid days of work, and a professional with real power tools has put in two more, and the concrete footing is finally completely gone.  \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Is this what they mean by \"pride of ownership?\"\r\n</p> ",

    "intro": "<p> Expansive, engaging interview with the author of the <i>Mars</i> trilogy, <a href=\"http://gerrycanavan.wordpress.com/2010/09/13/science-justice-science-fiction-an-interview-with-kim-stanley-robinson/\">Kim Stanley Robinson</a>.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> This, in a nutshell, is why I want to beat everyone over the head until they read his work.  The ideas from the <i>Mars</i> books resonate deeply with my aspirations for humanity, and my frustration that we're still <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/15/world/middleeast/15mideast.html\">fighting over real estate</a>:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><b>PG.</b> Late in Sixty Days and Counting one of your characters remarks \"Maybe we can't afford to fight capital anymore,\" suggesting that the seriousness of the environmental crisis demands that all political effort be marshaled towards its resolution, or at least its reduction. Do you see this as a temporary truce or a more permanent detente? Given the critiques of capitalism elsewhere in your work--including earlier in the Science in the Capital trilogy itself--does this represent a shift in your thinking about the prospect for radical political change? To put it another way, how can we be sure that a \"truce\" with capitalism is different from a surrender to it?\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>KSR.</b> Well, this was a Phil Chase statement, and he is a character prone to provoking his friends and colleagues by overstating things. He argues that if we have to reform capitalism and save the environment at the same time, we have too much on our plate--that the climate crisis demands immediate action, whereas getting beyond capitalism looks to be a long-term project at best--so he suggests that we configure the legal/economic landscape such that we can aim capitalism like a tool or weapon at the immediate problem at hand, which is swapping out the energy and transport systems very quickly, among other important changes.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> This might be good to try, but other characters and events in that novel make it clear, I hope, that because capitalism itself is a big part of the climate problem, really we need to attack the problem of capitalism's detachment from reality if we are to have any hope of stabilizing the climate and our relationship to the biosphere more generally. Not to mention justice among humans, which is a question with an environmental impact too.\r\n</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p> Alas, I haven't made time to actually <em>finish</em> reading the <i>Mars</i> trilogy.  I've been stalled about a third of the way through the last book.  I think I subconsciously just don't want it to end, so I put off reaching the conclusion.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Also, I should note that KSR's books are some of the only fiction I've read that really makes me feel like I really need to go back to school and get my head fully around some of the concepts he uses as the basis for his stories.\r\n</p>",

    "intro": "<p> Well, <em>that</em> was annoying.  I <em>always</em> set out on road rides with the following:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li> 1 spare inner tube\r\n<li> 1 16g cartridge of CO2\r\n<li> 1 patch kit\r\n<li> 1 pair of tire levers\r\n<li> 1 schrader-to-presta adapter.\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p> As I was climbing up the last hill (well off the back of the pack, naturally) I heard the leak in my front tire hissing at me as it came around.  So I pulled over at the next shady spot, and waved everyone else on as they sped by me down the hill.  \"Don't wait!  I'm good!  I'm fine, really!  Take off!\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I found the puncture in no time, established that whatever had caused it was not still lodged in the tire.  I pulled out the tube, and installed a new one.  And then I reached for the CO2.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> It was already attached to the nozzle.  Uh-oh.  This isn't a fresh cartridge.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I attached it to the tire, and opened the nozzle.  A short, weak hiss, then nothing.  There wasn't enough pressure even to keep the rim off the asphalt.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> No worries.  I have a schrader-to-presta adapter, so I'll just walk down to the market and use their compressed air.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> The market had no air.  And no bike pump.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> So I walked on to the next corner, where I hoped to find a gas station.  No gas station.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> As I was leaning on a fence by the road, a guy came out and warned me that the fence wasn't too sturdy.  Evidently a few guys had been sitting on it yesterday, and knocked the whole thing over.  We talked for a minute, and it turns out that he has a bike pump.  Hooray!  I'm saved!\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> His pump is for schrader valves.  No problem, I'll just un-screw the nozzle, flip over the little rubber thing, and... discover that it <em>still</em> won't go on my valve.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> No problem.  I have my adapter.  Right?  Wrong.  That's missing.  No clue where that got to.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> So I called a co-worker, who was kind enough to come pick me up.  Once back at work, I put air in my tire, put a brand new tube and CO2 cartridge in my saddle bag, and I've put a reminder in my day planner to put my bike pump on my bike.  I think I'm done with CO2, except for supported/group rides.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n",

As with all transitions, there's now some\r\nserious annoyance going on.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> First, for use of multiple monitors, Windows seems to\r\njust <em>kill</em> OS X.  And this is mostly because of Apple's UI\r\nconventions.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Putting an application's menu bar at the top of the screen,\r\ninstead of the top of the window, means that even if an application\r\nwindow is in a secondary monitor, it's menu bar is in the primary\r\nmonitor.  That's bad.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> And I'm going nuts with the oddity of OS X's mouse behavior.  Just\r\nbecause I'm moving the mouse quickly doesn't mean I want to move it\r\ncursor farther.  I want constant speed.  At the moment, I radically\r\novershoot items that are far from the cursor, and have trouble moving\r\nshort distances at all.  Net result: I want to smash my mouse with a\r\nhammer.  Why is there no system preference to turn this insanity off?\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> How the hell do I turn off translucence in Terminal windows?  It\r\njust screws with readability.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I'm a heavy EMACS user.  Who the hell thought it was a good idea\r\nto have M-o trigger <em>OS X's</em> file open menu?  I rebound M-o to\r\n'open file for a damn reason: I can type directory names faster than I\r\ncan click them.  Get the pop-up out of my way.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> That applies to all EMACS mac-ification measures.  It's all a bad\r\nidea.  I've been using EMACS for 12 years.  When I start it up, I want\r\nEMACS, not some odd variant of EMACS that ignores the settings in my\r\n.emacs file and tries to act like a native OS X application.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> And Entourage... holy crap does Entourage suck.  Never thought I'd\r\nmiss Outlook, but here I am, doing just that.\r\n</p>",

And because it's digital, I can make backups.  If\r\nmy phone disappers or dies, I still have my data.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> But I'm sticking with paper.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n",

(Gift cards, checks, receipts, stamps, prescriptions,\r\netc.) And there's enough space on the pages to take notes as\r\nwell.  <i>Things</i> on my iPhone doesn't cope well with\r\nsentence-length task descriptions or notes.  The net result of using\r\nthe day planner is that I have my to-do lists, my notes, and any small\r\nnecessaries in one neat package.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> And there are a few completely non-tangible reasons to stick with\r\na paper day planner.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> The Moleskine has PR value.  When I sit down at a meeting and open\r\nmy book, it tells everyone that I've got my act together.  I've had\r\nmore than one person remark on this, and I think it carries extra\r\nimpact because I'm a techie.  When I go old school, people notice.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> And while everyone I've met is understanding (even admiring) when\r\nI pause to write something in my planner, they get impatient with my\r\ntapping on a phone.  \"What are you doing?\" they ask.  They're yet more\r\nannoyed when I explain that I'm using a to-do list app.  Somehow,\r\npausing to write in a book is admirable, but pausing to tap\r\ninformation into a phone is geeky and annoying.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> And until I switched to <i>Things</i>, I didn't appreciate the\r\nmental benefits of leaving the book at home.  When I don't have the\r\nbook with me, I'm officially off duty.  With my to-do list in my\r\nphone, I think about it more, which is the <em>opposite</em> of what I\r\nwant.  \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I don't like the idea that with <i>Things</i>, my to-do lists sit\r\natop a stack of technologies, any of which could fail.  Backups are\r\ngreat, but there really is something to be said for a system in which\r\nI can track tasks, take notes, draw diagrams, hold necessary papers,\r\nand which never needs recharging, and can't be infected by viruses or\r\nmaimed by software glitches.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> And yes, I really like the look and feel of the Moleskine book and\r\nthe pens I use.  Making tactile and visual pleasures part of my daily\r\nlife is important too.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> So yeah.  <i>Things</i> is a fantastic program.  But I just don't\r\nsee a compelling need to change.  And that feeling is confirmed by the\r\ndistinct comfort of returning to my paper-only system.\r\n</p>"

    "intro": "<p> If you followed this year's Tour of California, this loop should look <a href=\"http://www.amgentourofcalifornia.com/Route/map/stage8.html\">familiar</a>.  I got off work early yesterday and took my bike out for a spin around the loop used for Stage 8, a circuit race around Thousand Oaks, Agoura, and Westlake Village.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> This is a <em>fantastic</em> loop.  The \"Rock Store\" climb is a local classic, and a fast time to the top confers big time bragging rights.  (I do <em>not</em> have a fast time to the top, hence no bragging.)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> And the descent down Decker Cyn. is fantastic fun.  I kept my speed above 25mph, and never saw a car the whole way down from Mulholland.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> On the second climb, up Mulholland, another cyclist caught up to me. \"How's it going?\" he asked.  \"Y'know,\" I replied between panting, \"I have felt stronger.\"  He laughed, and left me in the dust.  I caught sight of him two or three more times, each at a greater distance, and finally I lost him entirely.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> At 5 PM on a Friday evening, Westlake Blvd. and Agoura Rd. are both crowded with cars <em>and</em> boring to ride.  So despite legs that were already pretty tired, I took a detour up Ridgeford Dr., a short, very steep local climb.  By the time I got to the top, my legs were well and truly <em>cooked</em>, and it was time to head for home.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> My final time for this loop was north of 1:45 (I trimmed a little bit off the map to avoid posting a GPS map to my apartment), which puts me more than <em>an hour</em> behind the pace of the Tour of California riders.  And I just did one lap.  They did <em>four</em>.  I can't even imagine.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> It was <em>fantastic</em> to get out for a real ride after so many months of only riding on my lunch break.  I'd love to make this loop as part of my regular routine.  We shall see...\r\n</p>",

The\r\nsoundtrack is pretty incredible, so I check the end of the video.

And from the samples, it's wonderful stuff.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Now, compare that\r\nwith <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCIN6mJS5Tk&feature=player_embedded\">this\r\nvideo</a>, which had the audio track stripped out for copyright reasons.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> This is also why I love the net.

And I don't have a\r\nFirewire drive.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I followed\r\nthe <a href=\"http://www.ifixit.com/Guide/Repair/Installing-PowerBook-G4-Aluminum-15-Inch-1-1-5-GHz-Hard-Drive-Replacement/227/1\">instructions\r\non ifixit.com</a> for replacing the hard drive in my\r\nPowerbook, <a href=\"http://forums.macosxhints.com/showthread.php?t=110164\">posted\r\nto the OS X Hints forums</a>, and basically tried everything I could\r\nthink of, and finally got everything working again.

I'll sync that drive once a month or\r\nso, and keep it locked in a drawer at work.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> So I'm automated, and fully redundant: more than one copy in more\r\nthan one place.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> So I'm totally covered.  I think.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> And I'm going to do as Merlin Mann recommends, and have a couple\r\nof USB sticks with the absolutely vital stuff on them.  \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Now, it's true that you really don't know how good your backups\r\nare <a href=\"archive/2309\">until you try to restore</a> from them.  So\r\nI'll have to do that once in a while, too.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n"

McGinly <a href=\"http://www.lmsd.org/sections/news/default.php?m=0&t=today&p=lmsd_anno&id=1138\">has\r\nadmitted that the laptops given to students are equipped with a\r\nwebcam</a> that can be activated remotely to help locate a laptop, \"in\r\nthe event it was reported lost, missing or stolen so that the laptop\r\ncould be returned to the student.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> The extent to which the cameras were used remains unknown.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I'm sure that any minute now the school district will produce the\r\npaper trail indicating that the laptop had been reported lost,\r\nmissing, or stolen, and that the technical staff had been authorized\r\nto activate the webcam in order to help locate it. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I'm not holding my breath.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> The best part here is that the district cited the student for\r\n\"inappropriate behavior at home\" because they thought they'd caught\r\nhim <em>taking illegal drugs</em>.

    "intro": "<p> I've gotten <em>much</em> better over the last few years.  I used\r\nto try to remember everything, and rely on reminders from others.\r\nLooking back, it's a wonder I got through college.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> So here's The System as it currently exists:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n",
    "body": "<p> <b>I. Plan Your Work, then Work Your Plan</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I use a Moleskine day planner with one page per day.  Each day has\r\ntwo to-do lists: the work-related list, and the off-time list.  I do\r\nmy best to log <em>everything</em> I do each day.  When an item is\r\ndone, it gets a check next to it.  If it doesn't get done, it gets an\r\nX, and gets re-entered one the day when I plan to do it.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I also log important calls, car repairs, bills paid, flight\r\ninformation, confirmation numbers, etc. In the book.  Having a\r\ndetailed record of my days has been invaluable.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> And I've found that a simple, flexible system works better\r\nthan <a href=\"archive/142\">something more structured</a>.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>II. Get it in Writing</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Mistakes happen, and institutions do not care what their\r\nrepresentatives tell you on the phone.  They care only about what\r\nis <em>on record</em>.  When banks, landlords, billing offices, credit\r\ncards, etc. screw up, having them admit fault on the record is\r\nthe <em>only</em> way to keep the fallout from landing squarely on me.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> So I make sure to get a letter from them stating what happened.\r\nIt has to say what the mistake was, and that it was not caused by\r\nChris Raser.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>II a. Get a Receipt</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Any institution's favorite way to say <i>you're screwed</i> is,\r\n\"We have no record of that.\"  So make sure there's a record.  If you\r\nhave to turn in a form, don't just drop off the form or put it in the\r\nmail.  FAX or email it so that you can prove later not only that you\r\ndid send it, but what you sent.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>III. Automate the Payments</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> The single most effective measure I've taken to get my credit\r\ncards paid down and regain control of my finances has been to automate\r\npayments whenever possible.  Every paycheck gets sliced up and\r\ndistributed to my credit card companies, student loan servicing\r\ncompanies, and my savings account.  And every Monday and Friday I get\r\nmy allowance in cash.  Bottom line: I can only spend what's in my\r\nwallet, and the rest takes care of itself.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Having done this, I also recognize that mistakes happen, and that\r\nmy bank has been the culprit more than once. So I set up the automated\r\npayments, but I don't totally rely on them.  Every payday, I check all\r\nmy accounts to make sure they're up to date.  That way, the automation\r\nusually catches me when I forget something, and I usually catch\r\nfailures in the automation in time to fix them.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>IV. The Only Winning Move is Not to Play</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> You cannot outsmart a credit card company.  They have seen it all\r\nbefore.  Put the card away, automate the payments, check it twice a\r\nmonth to make sure you're on schedule, and never, ever use it.  Any\r\nother plan will not work.\r\n</p>\r\n"

We should be teaching neophyte\r\ndevelopers that, absolutely. Even though it's an apparently\r\nneverending job. But we should also be teaching them the very real\r\ndifference between parsing HTML and the simple expedience of\r\nprocessing a few strings. And how to tell which is the right approach\r\nfor the task at hand.\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p> Absolutely.  Weighing the strengths and weaknesses of different\r\napproaches to a problem is absolutely central to the practice of\r\nsoftware development.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> But there's an even bigger lesson lurking here.  \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n",
    "body": "\r\n<p> When you first start, it's really easy to handle 90% of cases with\r\na couple of regexps.  And if that's good enough, so be it.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> But as the program grows, parsing code intermingles with\r\nprocessing logic, the code gets steadily more fragile. Eventually\r\nevery bugfix requires a new regexp, and every regexp introduces two\r\nnew bugs, and the descent into madness is complete.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> At the beginning, using regexps was clearly the right choice.  And\r\nat every step along the way, <em>continuing</em> to use regexps was\r\nclearly the expedient choice.  But at the end, when every change to\r\nthe code involves long hours of tear-your-hair-out debugging, using\r\nregexps is very, very <em>wrong</em>.  But you're stuck; switching\r\nfrom rexexps to a more robust tool takes more time than you have, and\r\nsticking with regexps makes maintenance too expensive to continue.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Chosing the right tool for the job is just the beginning.  One\r\nmust manage the growth of a piece of software as one tool reaches its\r\nlimits and a new one is required.  And <em>that</em> is what's missing\r\nfrom most undergrad programs.  Programs are built once, given a grade,\r\nand then abandoned.  There's very little chance to build the know-how\r\nto make small, cheap course corrections as a project grows, rather\r\nthan hurculean, bet-the-business overhauls later on.  Just as\r\nimportant as recognizing the right tool is knowing when the tool you\r\npicked two years (or two weeks) ago has reached the end of its\r\nusefulness, and having the foresight to build a program that can\r\nsurvive the transition to a new tool, and thrive afterward.\r\n</p>"

    "intro": "<p> BusinessWeek has an excellent (and concise!) article\r\n  on <a href=\"http://www.businessweek.com/smallbiz/content/sep2006/sb20060927_259688.htm\">how\r\n    to run a meeting like Google</a>.  More specifically, these are Google\r\n  VP of search products Marissa Mayer's rules of how to run meetings.\r\n  BusinessWeek titled their article \"How to Run a Meeting like Google\",\r\n  but I'll go further and say that these are good rules for everyone.\r\n  I <em>love</em> 'em, and I'm going to brazenly copy and paste them\r\n  below so that they never get lost.\r\n</p>",
    "body": "<dl>\r\n  <dt>1. Set a firm agenda.</dt>\r\n  <dd>\r\n    <p>Mayer requests a meeting agenda ahead of time that outlines\r\n      what the participants want to discuss and the best way of using\r\n      the allotted time. Agendas need to have flexibility, of course,\r\n      but Mayer finds that agendas act as tools that force individuals\r\n      to think about what they want to accomplish in meetings. It helps\r\n      all those involved to focus on what they are really trying to\r\n      achieve and how best to reach that goal.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </dd>\r\n\r\n  <dt>2. Assign a note-taker.</dt>\r\n  <dd>\r\n    <p> A Google meeting features a lot of displays. On one wall, a\r\n      projector displays the presentation, while right next to it,\r\n      another projector shows the transcription of the meeting. (Yet\r\n      another displays a 4-foot image of a ticking stopwatch.) Google\r\n      executives are big believers in capturing an official set of\r\n      notes, so inaccuracies and inconsistencies can be caught\r\n      immediately.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Those who missed the meetings receive a copy of the notes. When\r\n      people are trying to remember what decisions were made, in what\r\n      direction the team is going, and what actions need to be taken,\r\n      they can simply review the notes.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </dd>\r\n\r\n  <dt>3. Carve out micro-meetings.</dt>\r\n  <dd>\r\n    <p>Mayer sets aside large blocks of time that she slices into\r\n      smaller, self-contained gatherings on a particular subject or\r\n      project. For example, during her weekly two-hour confab with the\r\n      co-founders and CEO Eric Schmidt, she sets aside five- to\r\n      10-minute segmentsÃ‚Â—or longer, depending on the subjectÃ‚Â—devoted\r\n      to such specific areas as weekly reports on how the site is\r\n      performing, new product launches, etc.</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>This method offers enough flexibility to modify the agenda\r\n      just before the meeting, should anything pressing occur. It also\r\n      instills discipline that keeps the meeting tightly\r\n      focused. Mayer does the same with members of her teams who might\r\n      need only five or 10 minutes of her time instead of 30\r\n      minutesÃ‚Â—the shortest block of time her calendar permits. By\r\n      setting aside micro-meetings within a larger block of time, she\r\n      accomplishes more.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p> Mayer, who has a background in engineering and computer\r\n      science, jokingly refers to micro-meetings as \"reducing latency\r\n      in the pipeline.\" That means if she has an employee with an\r\n      issue that comes up Tuesday, he or she can schedule a 10-minute\r\n      micro-meeting during Mayer's large time block, instead of\r\n      waiting for her next 30-minute opening, which might not be\r\n      available for two weeks.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </dd>\r\n\r\n  <dt>4. Hold office hours.</dt>\r\n  <dd>\r\n    <p>Mayer brought this idea from her experience teaching computer\r\n      science at Stanford, where she first met the two guys who would\r\n      go on to revolutionize how the world gets its\r\n      information. Beginning at 4 p.m., for 90 minutes a day, Mayer\r\n      holds office hours.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Employees add their name to a board outside her office, and\r\n      she sees them on a first-come, first-serve basis. Sometimes\r\n      project managers need approval on a marketing campaign;\r\n      sometimes staffers want a few minutes to pitch a design (see\r\n      BusinessWeek.com, 6/30/06, \"Inside Google's New-Product\r\n      Process\").\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p> Says Mayer: \"Many of our most technologically interesting\r\n      products have shown up during office hours. Google News, Orkut\r\n      [Google's social networking site], Google Reviews, and Google\r\n      Desktop all showed up first in office hours.\" During office\r\n      hours, Mayer can get through up to 15 meetings, averaging seven\r\n      minutes per person.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </dd>\r\n\r\n  <dt>5. Discourage politics, use data.</dt>\r\n  <dd>\r\n    <p> One of Mayer's \"Nine Notions of Innovation\" is \"Don't politic,\r\n      use data\" (see BusinessWeek.com, 6/19/06, \"9 Notions of\r\n      Innovation\").\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p> This idea can and should apply to meetings in organizations in\r\n      which people feel as though the boss will give the green light to a\r\n      design created by the person he or she likes the best, showing\r\n      favoritism for the individual instead of the idea.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p> Mayer believes this mindset can demoralize employees, so she\r\n      goes out of her way to make the approval process a science. Google\r\n      chooses designs on a clearly defined set of metrics and how well\r\n      they perform against those metrics. Designs are chosen based on\r\n      merit and evidence, not personal relationships.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p> Mayer discourages using the phrase \"I like\" in design meetings,\r\n      such as \"I like the way the screen looks.\" Instead, she encourages\r\n      such comments as \"The experimentation on the site shows that his\r\n      design performed 10% better.\" This works for Google, because it\r\n      builds a culture driven by customer feedback data, not the internal\r\n      politics that pervade so many of today's corporations.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </dd>\r\n\r\n  <dt>6. Stick to the clock.</dt>\r\n  <dd>\r\n    <p> To add a little pressure to keep meetings focused, Google\r\n      gatherings often feature a giant timer on the wall, counting down\r\n      the minutes left for a particular meeting or topic. It's literally\r\n      a downloadable timer that runs off a computer and is projected 4\r\n      feet tall.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p> Imagine how chaotic it must look to outsiders when the wall\r\n      shows several displays at onceÃ‚Â—the presentation, transcription,\r\n      and a mega-timer! And yet, at Google, it makes sense, imposing\r\n      structure amidst creative chaos. The timer exerts a subtle\r\n      pressure to keep meetings running on schedule.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p> Mayer does have one caveat when it comes to the timerÃ‚Â—maintain\r\n      a healthy sense of humor about it.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </dd>\r\n</dl>\r\n\r\n"

Alas,\r\nfear of snakes (and, y'know, state law) keept her on the leash.  She\r\noverheated after about 45 min, so Janell carried Henri a little way\r\nuntil she'd rested enough to get back to the car under her own power.\r\nHenri was pretty tired that night, but recovered the next day for a\r\nspirited run around the park.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> We stopped in at the ranger station so I could ask a few\r\nquestions, and I did my bit to support the park by buying a $10 map\r\nthat I'll probably never open again.  Or maybe I'll get lucky and find\r\na nice singletrack into the Sycamore Canyon that avoids the paved\r\naccess road.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> All our gear was great.  Janell invested in some great hiking\r\nboots, and they kept her comfy and blister-free across more than an\r\nhour of hilly trail.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Lots of fun was had by all, and we'll be headed back again this\r\nweekend!\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> It's been a while since <a href=\"archive/2104\">the last time I\r\nwent hiking</a>.  Mountain Biking kind of warped my brain, and I saw\r\nhiking as just slow and boring.  But as Janell and Henri and I\r\nwandered the trails on Sunday, I really enjoyed myself.  Rather than\r\nracing by in a blur, every rock and tree was in perfect focus, and\r\nthere was a clarity and serenity that I'd forgotten about.  I'm really\r\nlooking forward to doing this more often.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> It'll be a challenge to keep Janell excited.  I don't mind doing a\r\nhalf-dozen favorite trails over and over, but she hates doing the same\r\nthing twice in a row.  And having Henri along actually opens up new\r\noptions.  Trails I might have skipped because they're too short are\r\nnow perfect!  So it's time to dig back into the hiking books I have\r\nand see what's out there!\r\n</p>\r\n"

Atwood publicly\r\nabsolved his hosting provider of any blame, and realized that he should have had his own backups.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Let's be clear: Yan wants Blogger, a free service, to go find and reinstate his blog.  Atwood, who\r\npaid good money to a hosting service that was <em>supposed to have\r\nbackups of everything</em>, just got busy rebuilding as best he could.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Now, I completely understand where Yan is coming from.  He's been\r\nextremely patient, he's trying to help a friend, and Google has the\r\nonly existing copy of the blog.  So there's just no other way to go.\r\nBut still.  This is much less a story of how Google fails and much\r\nmore a story of why you shouldn't build anything you care about on\r\nsomeone else's foundation.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> This blog runs on a server I rent from a hosting service, using a\r\ndomain name I own, software I wrote, and data I created and own.  I\r\nhave backups of <em>everything</em>.  So if my ISP goes kerplooey, I\r\njust install everything on a new server and I'm back up and running in\r\na <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiffy_(time)\">jiffy</a>.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> The moral to all these stories is: <b>If your data is important to\r\nyou, make your own backups.</b>\r\n</p>\r\n",

[check!<sup>*</sup>]\r\n  <li> Take at least one 4-day camping trip.\r\n  <li> Test for my orange belt in Krav Maga.\r\n  <li> Do fun stuff to stay in shape.  [check!]\r\n  <li> See four big-ticket concerts this year. [check!]\r\n  <li> Draw regularly.\r\n  <li> Play music regularly.\r\n  <li> Buy only what I really need. [check!]\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p> 2009 was such a big year that understatement is the only way to\r\ngo.  It was big.  My girlfriend and I took huge steps in our\r\nrelationship, and we adopted our dog <a href=\"archive/2238\">Henri</a>.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> So, like <a href=\"archive/2080\">2008</a>, moving toward several\r\nhuge life goals crowded out a few of the smaller things I'd hoped to\r\naccomplish.  I'll swap a Krav Maga orange belt for a new car, a dog,\r\nand a fantastic girlfriend.  Hell yes I will.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I had <em>huge</em> success managing my finances.  I got my\r\nmedical expenses under control with a Flexible Spending Account\r\nthrough my employer, and I <a href=\"archive/2256\">swapped my Jetta for a Civic</a> to stop the\r\ncar repair treadmill.  I stopped using my credit cards entirely, and\r\nautomated biweekly payments through my bank.  And we got medical\r\ninsurance for Henri, which has already proven to be golden.  \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I've largely stuck to my resolution to buy only what I really\r\nneed, and I took a break from Krav Maga and Brazilian Jiu Jitsu.\r\nThat's made a big difference in my monthly budget.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> The net result is that I'm in my best financial shape in years.\r\nHallelujah.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> And I'm going to call my resolution to maintain my body weight\r\nbelow 175 lbs. a success.  I currently weigh about 184 lbs, but I'm\r\nregularly biking at lunch, eating fewer deserts, and I'm slowly,\r\nsteadily slimming down and getting into better shape.  Rather than\r\ndieting to drop weight and then trying in vain to keep it off, I'm\r\nmaking across-the-board changes that are making me healthier.  To me,\r\nthat's <em>better</em> than my original resolution.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> And my current score on\r\nthe <a href=\"http://betterme.org/cleansweep.html\">Clean Sweep life\r\nassessment quiz</a>: 90.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> So, this year's resolutions (drum roll, please!):\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li> Return all calls or email within 24 hours.\r\n  <li> Call all my friends at least once a week.\r\n  <li> Continue to pay down my debt.\r\n  <li> Do fun stuff to stay in shape.\r\n  <li> Don't eat so many cookies.\r\n  <li> Buy only what I really need.\r\n  <li> Put <em>everything</em> that needs to be done into my day\r\n  planner.\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p> If I do all that, I can keep moving in the right directions, and\r\nstill leave room for some of the big stuff I'm working toward.\r\n</p>"

    "intro": "<p> Two excellent blog entries popped up in my reader this morning,\r\nboth on a subject that's near and dear to my heart: backups.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> First comes the tale\r\nof <a href=\"http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001315.html\">Jeff\r\nAtwood</a>, who reminds us that nobody is responsible for securing\r\nyour data but <em>you</em>.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n  Then I belatedly realized that this was, after all, my data. And it is\r\n  irresponsible of me to leave the fate of my data entirely in someone\r\n  else's hands, regardless of how reliable they may or may not\r\n  be. Responsibility for my data begins with me. If I haven't taken\r\n  appropriate measures, who am I to cast aspersions on others for not\r\n  doing the same? Glass houses and all that.\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p> And Joel Spolsky reminds us\r\nthat <a href=\"http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2009/12/14.html\">no\r\nuntested system can be relied upon</a>:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n  <p> But let's stop talking about \"backups.\" Doing a backup is too low\r\n    a bar. Any experienced system administrator will tell you that they\r\n    have a great backup plan, the trouble comes when you have to restore.\r\n  </p>\r\n  <p> And that's when you discover that:</p>\r\n  <ul>\r\n    <li> The backed-up files were encrypted with a\r\n    cryptographically-secure key, the only copy of which was on the\r\n    machine that was lost\r\n    <li> The server had enormous amounts of configuration information\r\n    stored in the IIS metabase which wasn't backed up\r\n    <li> The backup files were being copied to a FAT partition and\r\n    were silently being truncated to 2GB\r\n    <li> Your backups were on an LTO drive which was lost with the\r\n    data center, and you can't get another LTO drive for three days\r\n    <li> And  a million other things  that can go wrong  even when you\r\n    \"have\" \"backups.\"\r\n  </ul>\r\n  <p> The minimum bar for a reliable service is not that you have done a\r\n    backup, but that you have done a <em>restore</em>.\r\n  </p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p> So, I'll be making a backup of all my stuff tonight.  You should\r\ndo the same.  The holidays are crazy.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> If you don't have a backup system, stop whatever you're doing\r\nright now and go\r\nread <s>JWZ's quick\r\nwriteup</s> <a href=\"archive/2311\">my quick writeup</a> on how to do it.  His system is <em>awesome</em>: if the\r\nhard drive in his computer fails, he just connects the backup drive\r\nand reboots.  Just a few minutes of time lost (not counting the lost\r\nwork).\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Update:</b> Fred is absolutely right in the comments below that Jamie Zawinski's (AKA JWZ) writeup probably isn't the best resource to link to here.  So I've done my own <em>very</em> fast writeup on how I back up my own files, and posted it <a href=\"archive/2311\">here</a>.\r\n</p>",

In the (admittedly,\r\n  unlikely) event that I say something smart in public, it would be good\r\n  if the public heard it.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Earle says, \"Daring Fireball gave me about one new visit a second,\r\n  for over an hour.\"  So that's the metric I'll aim for.  \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I just checked, and it looks like I'm doing a page about every 1.2\r\n  seconds.  Way too slow.  So I've got work to do.  \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> First, I'll check for obvious software improvements that I can\r\n  make that will obviate further effort.  Maybe I'm making repeat calls\r\n  to the database, or I've got my transaction settings wrong.  Maybe I'm\r\n  running queries that I don't need to.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> So let's say I check, and make the obvious improvements, but I'm\r\n  still not where I need to be.  What next?\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Developers, listen up: your instinct is going to be to start\r\n  implementing object caches, and switching from POJO to EJB data\r\n  access layers, and... and... and.  All of this is wrong.  You are\r\n  solving the wrong problem.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Let's review:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I want to <em>serve one page every second</em>.  So once I hit the\r\n  point of diminishing returns (and believe me, EJB is that point), it's\r\n  time to reach for the next power tool.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> So I'm not going to micro-optimize my loops and whatnot.  That's\r\n  going to take a lot of time I just don't want to spend.  \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> So I'll reach for a bolt-on caching engine.  If I do any\r\n  development at all, it'll be to make sure I'm playing well with the\r\n  cache.  Return codes are easy and pretty quick.  Implementing a\r\n  high-performance HTTP cache is not.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> And if that still doesn't work, I'll talk to Akamai.  Because I'll\r\n  have so much traffic I'll be able to monetize like a mofo.\r\n</p>\r\n",

And in the second case, the practitioner imposes no\r\nwill at all; he's just going through the motions.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Finding the middle ground is just as much mental as physical.\r\nIt's a game of channelling energy without trying to regulate it, of\r\nleaving distractions aside without surrendering mindfulness.  It's a\r\nmeditative practice as much as a physical exercise.\r\n</p>\r\n",

    "intro": "<p> I watched a <em>lot</em> of movies this week.  I was home sick on\r\nTuesday and Wednesday, and ploughed through several movies each day.\r\nAnd my girlfriend and I got out to the local theater on Friday night,\r\nand put in a DVD last night.\r\n</p>\r\n",
    "body": "<p> <b>WALL-E</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> What a great little movie.  Thoroughly enjoyable.  I loved the\r\npart where EVE realizes all the things that WALL-E did for her while\r\nshe was waiting to be picked up.  Just great.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Jagged Edge</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> A great reminder of how good the 80's were.  Glenn Close is\r\nespecially wonderful.  I was convinced of the movie's twists and turns\r\nbecause <em>she</em> was totally convinced.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I liked <i>Old Boy</i>, but was also kind of sorry that I watched\r\nit.  It sticks in your head like a bad dream.  Same deal\r\nwith <i>Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance</i>.  Several moments that were\r\nreally just plain disturbing.  At the same time, I'm in awe of\r\nChan-wook Park's ability to tell a story visually, rather than\r\nstuffing a lot of exposition into dialogue.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I'll finish off the \"vengeance trilogy\" with <i>Lady Vengeance</i> as soon as I find a proper chaser.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>The Babysitters</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Netflix kept recommending this to me, but I was skeptical.  The\r\npremise: a babysitter has an affair with a married man, and decides to\r\nuse a \"babysitting service\" as a front for prostitution.  Um, eeeeew.\r\nBut John Leguizamo stars, and it was available via Netflix's \"Watch\r\nInstantly\" on my Roku, so I figured I'd give it a whirl.  Maybe it\r\nwould be be a farce like <i>American Pie</i>.  Or (dare I hope?) I'd\r\nget something like <i>Election</i>.  Anyway, I was home sick, and\r\nbored, and thought, \"What the hell?\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I simply couldn't get past the implausibility of a bunch of high\r\nschool girls starting a prostitution ring.  That wouldn't matter in a\r\nfarce, but <i>The Babysitters</i> aims to be very dark.  But to\r\nbe <em>really</em> dark, you have to be <em>really</em>\r\nbelievable.  <i>Requiem for a Dream</i> was horrifying precisely\r\nbecause every plot point was so credible.  \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> That said, the acting is fantastic, the writing sharp, the story\r\nengrossing, and the inevitable train wreck ending was timed perfectly:\r\nit hits just when you think you're safe for a little longer.  The\r\nmovie kept surprising me with unexpected plot points and character\r\ndevelopment.  It rarely took the obvious path.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>The Big Chill</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Easily one of my favorite movies of all time.  Every time I watch\r\nit, I see something new, and it's usually because I'm older than I was\r\nthe last time I saw it.  The first time, I just liked the story.  The\r\nsecond, the characters' struggles to finding lasting, satisfying\r\nrelationships resonated deeply.  Now I hear the undertone of outgrown\r\nidealism and self-doubt, and the tremendous reassurance of being among\r\nold friends.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>The Fantastic Mr. Fox</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> This movie is great.  Lots of fun.  The animation is at its best\r\nwhen it's at its least reserved.  Wes Anderson is God.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Monsoon Wedding</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I'm not sure I caught everything.  More and more, I'm annoyed by\r\nsubtitles.  While I'm reading, things are happening on screen.  And\r\nthis movie has <em>lots</em> of dialog.  So I feel like I\r\nmissed <em>lots</em> of what was happening visually.  Which is a\r\nshame, because whenever everybody shut up for a second, I got a\r\nglimpse of a really stunning movie.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>The Holliday</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> My girlfriend and I got about an hour into this one.  At that\r\npoint, nothing had happened yet.  Maybe some time we'll see if\r\nanything happens in the second half.  \r\n</p>"

    "intro": "<p> Alas, no pictures.  Time is scarce these days, and I generally\r\nhave two goals when I ride: go fast &amp; hard, and get my workout.\r\nAnd stopping to take pictures serves neither of these.  So I don't\r\nhave any pictures from last few rides.  But they've been great rides.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> A co-worker and I turned in a very speedy loop at lunch on\r\nThursday.  He pulled most of the way, but I took a couple shifts on\r\nthe way back into the headwind, and we ended up with an average for\r\nthe hour just under 19 mph.  Not bad.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Saturday afternoon I decided to head for Wildwood, and ended up\r\nexploring some of the trails east of the cross along what I guess is\r\nthe Santa Rosa trail.  A fire road runs east from the cross, but\r\nquickly narrows into a nice stretch of singletrack.  The trail\r\nfeatures a couple of options after that, as it splits and rejoins\r\nitself a couple of times, forming a stretched out figure-eight.  (See\r\nthe map, it'll make sense.)  The trails on the high side, closer to\r\nthe ridge are more technically challenging, but the low side is no\r\ncakewalk either.  These were right at my current \"sight reading\"\r\nability.  I dabbed once, and rode both stretches both eastward and\r\nwestward.  Great fun.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> That trail meets the grounds of the local YMCA.  It's not clear\r\nwhere public trails end and private land begins, so I pedaled\r\ndelicately through the YMCA property and along some of the trails\r\nleading east from there.  They're overgrown, not very challenging, and\r\ndon't seem to go anywhere, as they're hemmed in by the canyon around\r\nthe Norwegian Grade.  So I won't be back.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> But it was a great ride overall, and I'll be back to ride that\r\nsemi-techie stretch of Santa Rosa as time allows.\r\n</p>\r\n",

    "intro": "<p> It's been a long while since I spent a day riding the local\r\ntrails.  And I've been itching to get back to the trails around Simi\r\nPeak.  I used to ride in the area very regularly, but haven't been\r\nback since I moved to Agoura Hills in May.  So, it was time.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I took the day off of work, and spend the day criss-crossing the\r\nbest trails around Simi Peak.\r\n</p>\r\n",
    "body": "<p> The map really speaks for itself.  Five hours and fourty-five\r\nminutes of riding, three major climbs, and a lot of distance covered.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Descending Chumash was an absolute treat.  What keeps me\r\ninterested in mountain biking is going out on every ride and doing\r\nsomething that I couldn't do before.  So it was really satisfying to\r\nfinally ride a section of Chumash that I've stopped to work on several\r\ntimes before, but never managed to complete.  Unfortunately, I didn't\r\ntake a picture or mark the location, so you'll just have to take my\r\nword for it.  This was the only remaining section of Chumash that I\r\ncouldn't ride, so it's a rush to finally ride Chumash from start to\r\nfinish without walking.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> What's more, I was able to ride the rock garden where\r\nI <a href=\"archive/1730\">took a fall a while back</a>.  I'm a much\r\nstronger, more confident rider than I used to be, and I was finally\r\nable to get that fall out of my head and just ride.  (I mean, it's not\r\neven a hard rock garden, for crying' out loud.)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Devil's Canyon is increasingly aptly named.  Fallen trees, trail\r\nthat's overgrown to the point of being invisible, and stream crossings\r\nthat suck wheels and shoes down into the muck.  It really presents a\r\nvariety of terrains, and some of it is absolutely breathtaking.  But\r\nuntil there's <em>extensive</em> trail maintenance done, I won't be\r\nback.  At least, not on a bike.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I found skill and stamina that I didn't know I had while climbing\r\nJohnson Fire Rd.  I remember that climb as a <em>killer</em>, and even\r\nconsidered skipping it today.  I'm glad I didn't.  I found a\r\nsustainable pace, and made easy work of nearly all the technical\r\nsections.  I only walked two sections: the first rocky patch after the\r\n<a href=\"galleries/456\">burned-out house</a>, and the very last\r\nsection before it levels out and heads for Rocky Peak road.  The first\r\nrequires short-term power that just wasn't in my legs after several\r\nhours of riding.  The second is extremely loose and gravelly on one\r\nside, hellishly hard and bumpy on the other.  It's tough when I'm\r\nfeeling strong and fresh, and today I just didn't want to burn my last\r\nfew matches all at once.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Over the last couple of days I weighed finishing with Hummingbird.\r\nI'd never ridden it before (and I still can't really say that I have),\r\nand I know it's a bear.  But I know I'm a stronger rider than I used\r\nto be, so I wanted to give it a try.  I'm glad that I did: I learned\r\nthat I <em>never, ever want to ride Hummingbird again</em>.  There are\r\njust too many sections that scare the hell out of me.  A lot of it is\r\nstrictly full-suspension-only territory.  It's not just that it makes\r\nme nervous.  I look at some of it and think, \"People\r\nride <em>that?</em>\" But I had fun riding what I could (which was more\r\nthan I expected), and enjoying a great view of the sunset over Simi.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> And finally, as I was pedalling through the trees at the base of\r\nHummingbird, I spotted a huge coyote howling atop a boulder.  Classic\r\ncoyote <em>yip-yip-yoooooooooo</em>, and a spectacular sight to wrap\r\nup a spectacular day on the bike.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p> And now, the technical stuff that's boring to everyone, but that I include here so I can refer to it later.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Clothing</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li> Underarmour boxer briefs (long)\r\n  <li> Patagonia Lightweight Endurance Ankle Socks\r\n  <li> Pearl Izumi P.R.O. Bib Shorts\r\n  <li> Twin Six Black Argyle jersey\r\n  <li> Pearl Izumi Thermafleece arm warmers\r\n  <li> Fox Reflex gloves\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p> Temps were in the mid 60's.  I originally layered an Underarmour\r\ncompression top under my jersey, but when I got to the trailhead it\r\nwas obvious I wouldn't need it, so I left it behind, and went with\r\njust the arm warmers.  When the wind lulled and the sun was shining,\r\nI'd start thinking it was time to put away the arm warmers, and ten\r\nseconds later a cold wind would kick up, and I'd be really glad I had\r\nthem.  I continue to be floored by the versatility of the jersey/arm\r\nwarmer combination.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Food</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I drank two liters of water mixed with two single-serving packets\r\nof mandarin orange Hydro Boom.  As always, this just wasn't doing it\r\ntoward the end, but did the job.  For rides this long, I really should\r\nbe drinking something with protein anyway.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I supplemented that with two Peanut Chocolate Chip Clif Bars.  The\r\nfirst went down easy, the second was less than awesome.  They did the\r\njob, but if I ever do a 24-hr race or similar lunacy, I'll have to\r\nwork out a better food plan.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Bike</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> My bike remains largely stock, with two upgrades: I swapped out\r\nthe original wheels for Mavic Crosstrails, and installed Avid BB7 disc\r\nbrakes.  Both continue to perform admirably.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> My fork, however, is <em>toast</em>.  No damping, and it bottomed\r\nout a few times when it should have held firm.  One more reason to put\r\nthe bike away until I can get my hands on the new fork.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> The plan is to get a new Fox F100 fork installed.  But that's\r\nmoney I just don't want to spend on my bike at the moment.  I have\r\nmore important things to spend it on.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Performance</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I've only done two other rides like\r\nthis: <a href=\"home/maps/20080426-wildflower.gpx\">Wildflower</a>, and\r\nthe <a href=\"home/maps/20080510-alberson-cheeseboro.gpx\">long ride</a>\r\nI did about a year and a half ago.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> This ride was far harder than either of those two.  Far more\r\nclimbing, on far more technical trails.  And I managed to ride several\r\nsections that I never have before.  So I'm really happy with how I fared.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Recovery</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> The day after, I'm a little tired and sore, but not as much as I\r\nexpected.  I did two things this time around that I think made the\r\ndifference.  First, I stayed fueled during the ride.  I had about 160\r\ncalories &amp; electrolytes in the CamelBak, and supplemented that\r\nwith two Clif bars (240 cal. each).  All together, that's about 640\r\ncal, whic is a lot more than I think I had on either Wildflower or my\r\nprevious long ride.  I felt the difference.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Second, I got a full meal within 30 minutes of finishing the ride.\r\nI got back to my car, changed out of my bike stuff and into warm,\r\ncomfy clothes, and headed straight for The Habit for my traditional\r\npost-ride meal: grilled BBQ chicken with avocado, fries, and an Arnold\r\nPalmer.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I weighed myself when I got home, and was still down a couple of\r\npounds, so I made a concious effort to drink water frequently for the\r\nrest of the night.  As long as the water tasted good, I drank.  I\r\nthink I only took in about 700ml or so, but it felt right.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n"

I did me.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n  <p> Before the birth of modern medicine, hospitals were poorhouses where\r\n    the indigent went to die. Then came the advent of effective medicines,\r\n    especially antibiotics, along with a revolution in medical schools.\r\n  </p>\r\n\r\n  <p> [...]\r\n  </p>\r\n\r\n  <p> Health care became much more effective, and much more expensive. Clean\r\n    hospitals, educated doctors and real pharmacological research cost\r\n    money. People proved willing to pay for care when they were really\r\n    sick, but it wasn't yet common to go for checkups or survivable\r\n    illnesses.\r\n  </p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p> Read the whole thing at <a href=\"http://www.wbur.org/news/npr/114045132\">WBUR</a>.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

I headed out to Cheeseboro Canyon for a\r\nmuch-needed trail ride.  I'm mulling a long ride from Wildwood to\r\nSycamore Canyon and back, but it had been several weeks since I'd been\r\non my mountain bike, and even longer since I did anything longer than\r\n2 hours.  So I wanted to see if I've got the legs for a 5-6 hour ride,\r\nor whether I'd have more fun doing something like a 3-4 hour ride in\r\nmy old stomping grounds northeast of Simi.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I was worried when my legs started out stiff, and began to burn on\r\nthe very first, easy climb.  Then I remembered that\r\nthey <em>always</em> start out stiff, and <em>always</em> feel\r\nsluggish until I push them a little bit.  I rode up the Canyon to Simi\r\nPeak (with a detour down Dead Cow Trail), and had a blast.  I very\r\nnearly got the final stretch up to Simi without dabbing, but was\r\nsabotaged by a tree branch that caught my handle bars.  Damn.  Next\r\ntime for sure!\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> The net result was a really fun ride, and my legs\r\nare <em>definitely</em> good to go for an all-day spin.  I'll be\r\nplanning the route over the next few days, and riding Wednesday or\r\nThursday.  We shall see.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> No GPS tonight because the battery was dead, and no pictures\r\nbecause the camera was in the car.  Doh!\r\n</p>\r\n",

    "intro": "<p> My girlfriend and I had a conversation with a woman at the park\r\nthe other night.  The nutshell is that Henri took a detour and\r\nmomentarily interrupted a kids' soccer game.  A woman got Henri under\r\ncontrol (which I greatly appreciated), and then started telling us\r\nabout how we should be training Henri (which I\r\nappreciated not at all).\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> She said we should ignore Henri when she jumps up, then patted her thighs and called to Henri, a gesture we <em>only</em> use when we <em>want</em> Henri to come.  She jerked Henri's leash to \"correct\" her, and bumped Henri with her knees.  Henri's body language changed immediately from ears up and tail wagging furiously to ears back, tail down, crouching, confused, looking for an exit.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> The woman then asked if we watched \"The Dog Whisperer,\"  and began a whirlwind lecture on how we should abandon the harness we use to walk Henri and switch to a collar or the loop end of the leash, etc.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> At that moment in time, the woman's will was good, her tone was friendly and helpful, and she\r\ncertainly had some good advice about how to show Henri how to be a\r\npolite, people-friendly dog.  The woman read Henri's behavior well.\r\nBut she failed to read mine at all.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I was physically drained after a long day at work and a fast bike\r\nride at lunch, and mentally and emotionally exhausted after sleeping\r\nbadly all weekend.  After chasing a runaway pup across the park and\r\nbeing embarrassed, I didn't need instruction.  I needed encouragement.  I wanted to wring her neck for\r\nacting as if training Henri should be easy.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> So I totally understand now why criticism of their dog bothers people so acutely.  The dog is their dear friend.  They've spent countless\r\nhours (and thousands of dollars, probably) providing the care and\r\nattention and training that dog needs. After they've given so much, what they're going to hear is, \"If you'd just given a little more....\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I really do appreciate the woman's help in corralling Henri, and welcome her advice on teaching Henri not to jump.   I imagine she was annoyed that we'd let Henri get away from us, and I'm sure we looked pretty foolish chasing a puppy across the park. I really tried to let go of being angry and embarrassed and listen to the woman's advice.  But try as I might, I still just couldn't get past the way she wouldn't let us get a word in edgewise.  In the end, walking away was an act of pure self-defense.\r\n</p>",

First, a variation\r\n  on <a href=\"http://regex.info/blog/2006-09-15/247#comment-3085\">JWZ's\r\n    famous quote</a>:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n  Some people, when confronted with a problem, think \"I know, I'll\r\n  create a custom scripting language.\"  Now they have two problems.\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p> Second, remember that config files are just programs written in\r\nsimplified language.

It should <em>not</em>\r\naffect the <em>behavior</em> of your program in any but the simplest\r\nsense.  When I hear that something is \"extremely configurable\", I get\r\na cold knot in my gut, and ask to see the config file.
