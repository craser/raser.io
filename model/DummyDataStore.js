So I've been practicing.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> My favorite video on cornering a mountain bike\r\n    is <a href=\"https://youtu.be/8y6ocZHpLoE\">this one by The Loam\r\n    Ranger</a>. I love that he establishes that leaning\r\n    the <em>bike</em> is key. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Focusing on that really helped. But something still wasn't\r\n    clicking. The video above on cornering motorcycles really helped.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> What I noticed was that the rider was setting up for the U-turn by\r\n    shifting his hips to the outside of the turn. Basically, for a\r\n    left turn, he'd put his left butt cheek on the saddle, and\r\n    vice-versa for the right.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> When I tried that, a few things happened naturally:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li> I made more space for my saddle to lean into the turn.\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li> Rather than trying to drop my outside foot all the way to the\r\n        \"6 o'clock\" position at the bottom of the stroke, I adopted a\r\n        stance with my inside foot <em>slightly</em> higher than my\r\n        outside foot, which I've heard called the \"60/40 stance\".\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li> That, in turn, let me lean the bike <em>much</em> more\r\n        easily, getting those all-important turning lugs planted in\r\n        the dirt.\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p> And all of this felt <em>much</em> more natural than ever\r\n    before. I feel more secure in the turns, and it feels so much more\r\n    secure than ever before.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> And the proof is in the pudding. There were <em>so</em> many\r\n    moments during last night's race where I was clearly carrying more\r\n    momentum through turns than before. In places where I used to just\r\n    be part of the conga line going through a twisty section, I was\r\n    often picking up time on the riders around me.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> My training goals for the rest of 2022 boil down to:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n    <li> get leaner (ideally, weight around 175#)\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li> build trail skills\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li> build my ability to sustain race pace with periodic 30- to\r\n        90-second punches at 400-500W.\r\n    </li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p> It's really great to be making solid progress on #2 there.\r\n</p>",

    "Intro": "<p> I've adjusted my training & nutrition to prioritize fat loss, and\r\n    it's working ever so gradually, just like it should. But man…\r\n    doing this The Right Way is... HARD.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p> It's going well. I'm down ~10lbs over ~4 months. I spoke with a\r\n    dietitian & implemented a few of her recommendations:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>less sugar/simple carbs</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> On days I don't ride, I've swapped my high-carb oatmeal breakfast\r\n    for scrambled eggs & a slice of toast. Snacks feature\r\n    veggies/hummus, etc.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>prebiotics & probiotics, fiber</b>\r\n\r\n<p> I now supplement to support gut biome health:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li> breakfast: fiber supplement\r\n    </li> \r\n    <li> lunch: prebiotics\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li> dinner: probiotics\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>more sleep</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> It's easy to stay up watching TV or playing games or\r\n    doomscrolling, and for me that results in ~6½hrs of sleep per\r\n    night. Getting in bed earlier & pushing that toward 7½hrs has\r\n    really helped.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>NOPE: more veggies</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I've gotten some more veggies into my diet, but not nearly\r\n    enough. There's 100% room for improvement here.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p> I've also made some adjustments to my training to prioritize fat\r\n    loss.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>consistently make time for weight training</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> My love of biking often leads me to want to skip my Thursday's\r\n    barbell session so I can give Friday's ride my all. But for me,\r\n    consistently doing SOMETHING every day is FAR more conducive to\r\n    fat loss than going hard every other day.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I have to remember that a new PR is nice, but what I really want\r\n    is a whole <em>stack</em> of new PRs as payoff for dropping this\r\n    extra fat I'm carrying around. I'll be healthier\r\n    &amp; <em>significantly</em> faster if I drop the extra weight.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p> <b>on-bike fueling</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I usually put Gu Roctane in both bottles. That keeps me fueled\r\n    through the end of the ride, which is good for recovery. But it\r\n    also means more sugar in my system than I really need. So now it's\r\n    1 bottle of Roctane, 1 of water.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> That cuts just 250 Cal from my daily intake, and my rides\r\n    typically burn 800-1400 Cal. But I find that\r\n    cutting <em>sugar</em> in particular has an outsized effect on\r\n    body composition.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p> <b>What's the Goal?</b>\r\n\r\n<p> I'm starting to notice clothes fitting differently, and\r\n    I'm <em>maybe</em> starting to notice that I'm feelign stronger on\r\n    the bike. So that's encouraging. I'm down from ~205# to reliably\r\n    under ~195#, and I'd love to get back down under 180#, where I was\r\n    in April of 2019. I felt <em>great</em> back then, and wasn't\r\n    strugling or pushing myself to maintain that.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "Intro": "<p> Races 4-8 were a steady progression of feeling stronger &amp;\r\n    getting better results. Each week I did better &amp; better,\r\n    climbing from 18th to 13th, which is <em>great</em>. I only placed\r\n    16th overall, but that's to be expected when I spent the middle of\r\n    the series finishing around 20th each week.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> 8 individual races kind of blur together, but I <em>did</em> learn\r\n    plenty during this time.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Initially, I was soft-pedaling into spots where I knew there would\r\n    be an accordion effect, thinking that I was saving energy. \"We're\r\n    all gonna be wheel-to-wheel in a second anyway,\" I'd think. And\r\n    then three riders would dive in ahead of me, which would hold me\r\n    up and/or push me off the fast line, and I'd come out the other\r\n    end of the accordion having surrendered 5 positions.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> In later races, I reframed the typical rhythm of open trail\r\n    punctuated by tight turns or bottlenecks. I relized that in a 40-\r\n    to 60-minute race, it's a sprint from start to finish. Saving\r\n    energy is <em>nice</em>, but you've gotta do\r\n    it <em>opportunistically</em> rather than <em>tactically</em>.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Meaning: <em>if</em> someone is going a little faster than\r\n    you, <em>and</em> you can draft, then draft. But it's\r\n    almost <em>never</em> a good call to draft behind someone slower than\r\n    you in hopes of \"resting\" or \"recovering\".\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I worked on my cornering, and discovered that (possibly because of\r\n    the current state of my skills) I'm <em>far</em> smoother carrying\r\n    speed through corners if I <em>stand</em>.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> And I found that I can totally stand &amp; power up climbs &amp;\r\n    pass people, and that this works <em>much</em> better for me than\r\n    trying to sit &amp; spin.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Between standing for power and standing through corners, my\r\n    approach to most of this race <em>completely</em> changed. I'd\r\n    brake late, carry speed through the corner (leaning the bike as\r\n    much as possible for more grip), then stay standing &amp; power\r\n    out, rinse &amp; repeat.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> And honestly, I think pushing myself each week did great things\r\n    for my fitness. Not only was I <em>performing</em> better each\r\n    week, I <em>felt</em> better after the race.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I haven't seen my heart rate hit 185 BPM in a <em>long</em> time,\r\n    but it did duringing these races.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Take-Aways</h2>\r\n\r\n<p> Most of what I learned from the <a href=\"archive/3398\">2019 Over\r\n        the Hump series</a> served me well. A few additions:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Pass when you can:</b> the twists &amp; turns of this race\r\n    offer little windows where passing is possible. Make the most of\r\n    those opportunities. Pass, then use the course to defend your\r\n    position &amp; recoup for a few seconds, then go again.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Foam rolling:</b> foam rolling is <b>amazing</b> and completely\r\n    eliminated any need for Sudafed/NyQuil after races. Never even\r\n    thought to reach for them.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Base layer:</b> I have a\r\n    few <a href=\"https://www.pearlizumi.com/US/en/shop/men/baselayers/road/transfer_mesh_sleeveless_baselayer/p/11122106\">sleeveless\r\n        base layer tops</a>, and I'm now <em>religious</em> about wearing\r\n    them. Even on the hottest days on the race course, I felt like my\r\n    sweat was <em>actually cooling me</em> rather than just dripping off\r\n    or evaporating uselessly.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Bike fit:</b> after getting frustrated with lingering saddle\r\n    sores, I got a fit from <a href=\"http://boscobikefits.com/\">Bosco\r\n    Bike Fits</a>, and it was money <em>well</em> spent. My sores\r\n    disappeared as if they never existed, and have not returned.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Roctane Recovery Mix:</b> It's not cheap, but I really do love\r\n    it. Fantastic recharge after hard workouts. I ran out during the\r\n    last couple of races, and replaced it with a simple mix of protein\r\n    powder, milk, and chocolate syrup, and that seemed to get the job\r\n    done well enough.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n",

    "Intro": "<p> The 2021 <a href=\"https://raceoc.com/\">Over the Hump</a> series\r\n    wrapped up on Tuesday evening, and I'll for sure have more to say\r\n    about how that went.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> For now, though, I want to document my starting numbers for my\r\n    next training block.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> The general plan is to spend the next few months with the\r\n    following priorities:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n    <li> get leaner\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li> get stronger\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li> don't lose on-bike fitness\r\n    </li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Current Measurements</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> The only metric here that I have any kind of goal for is my\r\n    weight. I'm <em>clearly</em> currently carrying more fat than I\r\n    need to, and some rough calculations indicate that getting down\r\n    around 15% body fat would put me right around <b>180#</b>. So\r\n    that's what I'm aiming for.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b><em>However.</em></b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> If I arrive in February 2022 leaner & stronger, but weighing above\r\n    180#, that's absolutely <em>not</em> any kind of failure. That's\r\n    why I take my other starting measurements, so that I can put my\r\n    weight in context. If my weight holds steady, but my waist goes\r\n    down and my thighs &amp; hips get bigger, that's a win.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center\">\r\n    <table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\">\r\n        <tr>\r\n            <th>weight</th>\r\n            <td>192.2#</td>\r\n        </tr>        \r\n        <tr>\r\n            <th>calf</th>\r\n            <td>16''</td>\r\n        </tr>        \r\n        <tr>\r\n            <th>thigh</th>\r\n            <td>25''</td>\r\n        </tr>        \r\n        <tr>\r\n            <th>hips</th>\r\n            <td>41''</td>\r\n        </tr>        \r\n        <tr>\r\n            <th>waist</th>\r\n            <td>39.5''</td>\r\n        </tr>        \r\n        <tr>\r\n            <th>chest</th>\r\n            <td>41''</td>\r\n        </tr>        \r\n        <tr>\r\n            <th>biceps</th>\r\n            <td>15.5''</td>\r\n        </tr>        \r\n    </table>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Strength Goals (5x5 max)</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Some of these goals are within reach over the next few\r\n    months.

    "Intro": "<p> Every movie has a moment where the characters are introduced, the\r\n    central plot is established, and everything after that proceeds\r\n    from what we already know. (A few twists & turns aside.)\r\n    It's <a href=\"https://www.braddailey.com/three-act-structure\">the\r\n    end of the beginning</a>.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I kind of feel like Race #4 was that moment for the 2021 Over the\r\n    Hump race season. Everyone's been moved to their proper divisions,\r\n    consistent winners have established themselves, and now we're all\r\n    just racing for incremental week-over-week improvement.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <a href=\"archive/3413\">I took 9th in my first race</a>, which felt\r\n    like a good start, but then finished 12th &amp; 22nd in the next 2\r\n    races. That prompted\r\n    some <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DeathB4Decaf/status/1422813392042090497\">re-evaluation</a>\r\n    of my goals and some investigation into how I slid 12 places in 15\r\n    days. The nutshell: a bunch of stronger riders either showed up,\r\n    or moved into Intermediate from other divisions.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> So, rather than looking at results, I looked at my time relative\r\n    to a rider who consistently finishes in the top 3 to get a sense\r\n    of how I was doing.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> In the first race, I finished ~1:30 behind him. In the second, I\r\n    was ~3:30 back. In the third, I was a miserable 4:40 off the pace.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> So, <em>both</em> things are true:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li> Riders stronger than me have joined my class\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li> I wasn't racing as well week-over-week.\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p> After race #3, I had a couple of take-aways.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> It is <em>immensely</em> clear that my trail skills have\r\n    atrophied. I'm not <em>nearly</em> as comfortable on trails as I\r\n    used to be, especially if they're loose. During races, I can feel\r\n    the extra effort taking its toll.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> The little, punchy climbs that litter the OtH courses were killing\r\n    me. I needed to get used to holding pace while periodically\r\n    pushing over short rises.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I'd also been following my TrainerRoad training plan, which\r\n    prescribed mostly rest between races, with an \"openers\" workout\r\n    the day before each race. I wondered how doing actual training\r\n    between races would affect my performance. (Both in terms of race\r\n    results, and whether I'd improve week-to-week.)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> So before race #4, I did some training rides during the week, and\r\n    moved them from power-based interval workouts done mostly on flats\r\n    to more race-specific stuff on trails.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> And honestly, that seemed to help a bit. For Race #4, I\r\n    was <em>much</em> better able to deal with the short rises.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Race #4 was honestly pretty uneventful. I was able to match my PR on\r\n    the <a href=\"https://www.strava.com/segments/654882?filter=overall\">back\r\n        lot climb</a>, which makes me happy, and I felt like I improved\r\n    the way I'm riding the first ~10 minutes of the race: didn't\r\n    overcook the start, maintained position well, and got onto the\r\n    flats with my HR at ~165 BPM, which is <em>exactly</em> where I\r\n    want to be.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I fumbled at least one place right at the end by not following\r\n    through over the top of the final climb. I had a gap on the rider\r\n    behind me, and I'd have kept it if I just pushed for another 5\r\n    seconds & gotten up to speed heading into the final 2:00 of the\r\n    race. I got passed with ~1:00 left to go, and that's entirely my\r\n    own doing. I did manage to <em>barely</em> hold off an attempt to\r\n    get past me right at the line.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> So, 4 races in, it's clear I've gotta work on three things, and\r\n    they're not subtle.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> First, I need to work on my cornering. I'm just bleeding time on\r\n    every single corner, and I absolutely <em>hate</em> my lack of\r\n    confidence in the turns. It's costing me time <em>and</em> fun.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Second, I'm going to do some YouTube research and see how faster,\r\n    more experienced racers deal with short rises. (~5 seconds)\r\n    There's a definite art to carrying momentum &amp; using minimal\r\n    energy to maintain/regain speed.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> And third, I simply have to get <em>faster</em>. When I was 1:25\r\n    off the lead, I felt like better skills &amp; tactics might close\r\n    the gap. But I'm 4:00+ back now, and that's down to my legs. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> And finally, I have to accept that if I'm going to win in\r\n    Intermediate, let alone move up to Sport &amp; be competitive\r\n    there, I'm going to have to get leaner. So I'm working on that. \r\n</p>\r\n",

    "Intro": "<p> After nearly two years, the Over the Hump Tuesday-night races are\r\n    back on the calendar. Instead of two six-week blocks with a hiatus\r\n    in between, it's a single eight-week series. I'd <em>love</em> to\r\n    see more racing, and a longer season, but after 22 months of\r\n    waiting, I'll take what I can get.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> My goals were super-simple: stay with the leaders as long as I\r\n    could, and race smart. I've been watching\r\n    a <em>lot</em> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIfRR1N2Gm1vjj9X955iWSQ\">race\r\n    tactics videos</a> on YouTube this year, so I like to think I'm a\r\n    smarter racer than I was two years ago.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Because of some delays at the venue, organizers shortened the race\r\n    from three laps to two, which I was slightly bummed about. The\r\n    last lap is usually where I'm able to pick up a few places. And a\r\n    short race means a brutal pace I wasn't sure I could hang with.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I got off the line clean, and everyone seemed to take their time\r\n    getting up to speed. I was with the leaders into the first turn,\r\n    and felt really solid. As we crested the top of the hill & headed\r\n    down to the road along Irvine Lake, gaps were forming and I was\r\n    crosseyed, but I had the leaders in sight & felt okay about my\r\n    position.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I did my best to breathe &amp; conserve energy on the flats, but\r\n    the pace was still <em>super</em>-high, and as we came through the\r\n    park &amp; onto the \"back 40\" section, I'd been gapped pretty\r\n    good. I figured with just two laps in the race this was the best\r\n    time to do whatever passing I was going to manage, and started to\r\n    work my way up through the traffic.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> It was <em>amazing</em> to push along the flats solo at 280W, then\r\n    tuck in behind someone and watch that number drop to 170W without\r\n    losing <em>any</em> speed. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> The flat finished with that hard left up the nose &amp; into the\r\n    CX section. I decided not to burn my matches there, and I feel\r\n    like that's the smart move there. It's maybe a 30-second climb, so\r\n    going into the red just gains you <em>maybe</em> 5 seconds, which\r\n    can be made up with minimal fuss later. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> My trail skills are rusty after so much fire road riding in my\r\n    training, and the course was really loose &amp; dusty. So I feel\r\n    like the back section took more out of me than it should have. (Or\r\n    at least, more than it used to.) \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I headed into lap 2 with no clue what position I was in. I just\r\n    tried to remind myself that there was no point saving any matches,\r\n    and that I really had maybe 15 minutes of racing left. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I managed to pick up a place coming through the park, and as I\r\n    headed into the \"Back 40\", I spotted a huge train motoring along\r\n    about 40m ahead. I've learned my lesson from so many crit videos,\r\n    and I know that I've gotta catch that.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> So catch it I did. I kept myself just shy of redlining, but\r\n    managed to join the back of that train &amp; get into that sweet,\r\n    sweet suction. I took a minute to rest, but realized that I had\r\n    one competitor just ahead, and another behind. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> The train started to split apart, so I jumped on my competitor's\r\n    wheel &amp; went with him for the rest of the flat section. A\r\n    glance back showed a nice gap, so I stopped looking for the guy\r\n    behind, and just focused on moving up.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> The guy I was following attacked up the nose climb, and I just\r\n    couldn't go. I hoped that if I could stay in striking distance I\r\n    could make up the time later in the lap, but after that he\r\n    was <em>gone</em>.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I had a nice gap after the final climb, but didn't want to take\r\n    that for granted. And I'm glad I didn't. A guy in my division\r\n    wearing all black managed to sneak up &amp; passed me going into\r\n    the second-to-last corner. <em>Very</em> fortunately, there was a\r\n    guy in another division just ahead of us and we all hit that\r\n    corner at the same time. Mr. All-Black was forced to\r\n    go <em>outside</em> of the other guy, but I had space to\r\n    pull <em>inside</em> &amp; get past them both. I spun up the hill\r\n    as fast as I could &amp; held on for 9th place. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> (My GPS says I hit 130+ RPM there, which seems unlikely, but\r\n    matches my experience at the time of just spinning as fast as I\r\n    could.)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I had high hopes for this race. I spent several months at the\r\n    beginning of 2020 <a href=\"archive/3402\">building muscle</a>, and\r\n    I've been pushing hard on the bike to build my fitness.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Unfortunately, it looks like I've mostly just <em>maintained</em>,\r\n    rather than improved. That's... disappointing.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> On the other hand, I'll get to do <em>eight</em> races this year\r\n    instead of just four back in 2019, and I\r\n    improved <em>significantly</em> during those four races back\r\n    then. I'm hoping I can do likewise this year.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> So, goals for next week:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li> start harder- stay with the <em>leaders</em>. I'm not 100%\r\n        convinced this will get me my best possible results, but I\r\n        really do feel like at this race the top finishers pull away\r\n        quickly &amp; stay away.\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li> more burning matches, more coasting. I spent a <em>lot</em>\r\n        of time just above FTP, and that meant I had nothing when I\r\n        needed to push harder. I want to see what happens when I, for\r\n        example, start hard, then coast &amp; draft along the flats,\r\n        then attack up the nose, then recover in the CX section, then\r\n        attack up the longer climb, then coast through the\r\n        start/finish, etc. Might be a terrible idea. Dunno. I want to\r\n        find out.\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>",

    "Image_Display_Class": "postcard",
    "Image_File_Type": "image",
    "Intro": "<h3>Upgrades!</h3>\r\n\r\n<p> First, I got a Stages left-crank power meter for my mountain\r\n    bike. The change has been <em>phenomenal</em>. Instant feedback on\r\n    technique means I'm really focusing on getting <em>faster</em>\r\n    rather than just building aerobic capacity as a proxy for power\r\n    output.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> That set the stage for joining TrainerRoad's training program. So\r\n    far, that's been awesome. I'm <em>clearly</em> getting much\r\n    stronger & faster, and I like the variety it provides over\r\n    something like <em>Time-Crunched Training Protocol</em>. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> And I've upgraded GPS unit, replacing my old Garmin Edge 500 with\r\n    a new Edge 130 Plus. Wireless sync has been awesome, and the\r\n    screen is <em>so</em> much clearer. Both units support structured\r\n    workout downloads from TrainierRoad, but the workout screen on the\r\n    130 Plus is <em>so</em> much better than what's available on the\r\n    500.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I also decided to try using a base layer just for grins, and I'll\r\n    never go back to just a jersey. I'm using a Pearl Izumi sleeveless\r\n    mesh base layer, and it keeps the chilly days from\r\n    being <em>too</em> chilly, and noticeably helps make hot days\r\n    manageable as well.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Saddle Sores</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p> I've never had trouble with saddles before this year. But now... I\r\n    do.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I suspect that the biggest reason is that I've been\r\n    doing <em>much</em> more training (indeed, <em>most</em> of my\r\n    training) on flat fire roads along the Santa Anna River Trail. On\r\n    trails (where I did most of my riding until now), there's much\r\n    more weighting & unweighting the saddle, shifting positions, etc.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Whatever the reason, saddle sores have been a persistent problem\r\n    for me for the last few months. So far, I've been lucky. They\r\n    haven't caused any disruption in my training or gotten beyond\r\n    merely annoying. But they're not going away, and I want to get\r\n    that resolved <em>before</em> it becomes a real problem.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> On the calendar, the next two weeks are rest & prep for a race in\r\n    Big Bear followed by a recovery week. So the plan is already\r\n    calling for very little time on the bike with lots of rest, and\r\n    workouts to maintain fitness rather than build it.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I won't be doing the Big Bear race, so I'm going to take advantage\r\n    of that low volume to get some extra rest &amp; minimize my time\r\n    in the saddle. I'm hoping that doing just 2-3hrs over the next\r\n    couple of weeks will let my sores heal completely.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I've also ordered a new seatpost that will give me more fine-tuned\r\n    tilt & setback options, and I have a new saddle with a slightly\r\n    wider body & more padding that I <em>hope</em> will help spread\r\n    some of the pressure & minimize hip rocking.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> And finally, once I'm healed I'm going to book a bike fit\r\n    at <a href=\"http://boscobikefits.com/\">Bosco Bike Fits</a> to get\r\n    my bike fit nailed down properly. I've never had a proper bike\r\n    fit, and I like to think that if I had, I'd wouldn't be dealing\r\n    with this now.\r\n</p>\r\n",

    "Intro": "<p> I've plotted a rough training outline for 2021, with the <em>Over\r\n    the Hump</em> races as B races, and some more classic style race\r\n    series on the radar as possibilities for A races if/when racing\r\n    resumes.\r\n</p>\r\n    \r\n<p> My goal for 2021 is to get on the podium as\r\n    an <em>Intermediate</em> racer, and set the stage for a move up\r\n    to <em>Sport</em> in 2022.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> For now, I'm using Strava's workouts (based on\r\n    Charmichael's <em>Time-Crunched Training Protocol</em>), and\r\n    making solid progress. Two-hour rides at 140 BPM feel easy, 150\r\n    BPM feels normal, and I'm doing intervals at 155-165 BPM to push\r\n    my FTP up. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> It's been a <em>long</em> time since I did real climbing repeats\r\n    at 170+ BPM, so my climbing is garbage at the moment.

But I feel like the time I\r\n    spend in my so-called <a href=\"archive/3405\">strength build</a>\r\n    was mostly <em>maintaining</em>, rather than <em>building</em>. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I got my game together during the quarantine, and pushed my bench\r\n    press, deadlift, and squat strength <em>way</em> up. I hit numbers\r\n    that mark excellent progress, and that I can live with for\r\n    now. I'll head back into a hypertrophy block in October-December\r\n    (might as well put those holiday calories to work...), and build\r\n    on that success.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Bike Performance</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I explicitly set out my goal to <em>play the long game</em>, to\r\n    work steadily toward my long-term goals, even at the expense of\r\n    short-term gains. For me, that means steadily working\r\n    toward <a href=\"archive/3405\">strength</a> and body composition\r\n    benchmarks first. It's increasingly clear that those are table\r\n    stakes for success in local races.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> With the 2020 OtH series first postponed, then postponed again, I\r\n    pretty quickly saw which way the wind was blowing and wrote off this\r\n    summer entirely. That, together with the shelter-in-place orders, made\r\n    strength work the clear best way to spend my training time between\r\n    March and July. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> So I'm not too concerned with my on-bike performance. I'm not as\r\n    quick as I was this time last year, but I'm <em>almost</em> as\r\n    quick on short climbs, and I know from experience that I can\r\n    extend that to build more endurance &amp; repeatability. I'm doing\r\n    a good job of maintaining a base of cardio/endurance fitness.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> What data I do have on my bike tells me that I'm pretty much on\r\n    par with where my training rides were this time last year. Given\r\n    the great progress I've made building strength in the last 8\r\n    months, I call that a win.\r\n</p>\r\n",

I think of it as playing the long\r\n    game. Instead of focusing on getting race-ready for 2020, I've\r\n    taken a step back from riding and instead spent some time on\r\n    barbell work to build a generally stronger, more capable body.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Goals</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I've cobbled together my long-term strength goals\r\n    from <a href=\"https://www.mensjournal.com/features/everything-you-know-about-fitness-is-a-lie-20120504/\">articles</a>,\r\n    <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Cyclists-Training-Bible-Joe-Friel/dp/1934030201\">books</a>,\r\n    <a href=\"https://www.trainerroad.com/blog/coach-chads-strength-training-recommendations-for-cyclists/\">blog\r\n    archive</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YOD1yXdOhE&t=142s\">YouTube\r\n    videos</a>, and my own experience.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<table border=\"1\">\r\n    <tr>\r\n        <th>&nbsp;</th>\r\n        <th>goal</th>\r\n        <th>current</th>\r\n    </tr>\r\n    <tr>\r\n        <th>squat</th>\r\n        <td>1.5 x BW (270#)</td>\r\n        <td>195#</td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n    <tr>\r\n        <th>deadlift</th>\r\n        <td>2.0 x BW (360#)</td>\r\n        <td>245#</td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n    <tr>\r\n        <th>bench press</th>\r\n        <td>1.5 x BW (270#)</td>\r\n        <td>140#</td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n    <tr>\r\n        <th>pull-up</th>\r\n        <td>10 @ BW</td>\r\n        <td>4 @ BW</td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Methods</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I've taken a step back from bike-focused training, and centered my\r\n    training around body composition and building strength &amp;\r\n    muscle mass. I've been down this road before,\r\n    with <a href=\"archive/3304\">disappointing results</a>, so this is\r\n    something of a leap of faith. But, I've made a couple of key\r\n    choices this time around that have really helped.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> First, I've stuck to the basics, and added <b>one</b>\r\n    complementary movement where I felt it was appropriate.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Second, I've ruthlessly avoided changing too much over time. I\r\n    want a solid framework within which I can apply progressive\r\n    overload to make my body stronger.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Third, I've tailored <em>one</em> workout a week to addressing\r\n    general mobility &amp; core strength, with some emphasis on a\r\n    couple of problem areas.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> It's <em>really</em> tempting to add too much. But I find that\r\n    most of these workouts clock in at around 1:15h, and on the hard\r\n    days they leave me wobbly. That tells me I'm doing enough.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Workouts</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> The primary goal is to build strength, and not necessarily to\r\n    build muscle mass. (I covered hypertrophy back\r\n    in <a href=\"archive/3405\">late 2019</a>.)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> For the primary movements (bench, pull-up, squat, deadlift), I've\r\n    taken a note from <a href=\"archive/3402\">Mass Made Simple</a> and\r\n    adopted a cycle of set/rep/load that seems to be working well:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n    <li> Workout #1: 3 x 5, 2 min rest between sets\r\n    </li>\r\n    \r\n    <li> Workout #2: 5 x 5, 90 sec rest between sets\r\n    </li>\r\n    \r\n    <li> Workout #3: 3 x 8, 2 min reset between sets\r\n    </li>\r\n\r\n    <li> Increse the load &amp; repeat the cycle.\r\n    </li>\r\n</ol>\r\n \r\n<p> Basically, start by doing enough volume to get used to the load\r\n    &amp; trigger some growth. Then push up the volume, and finally,\r\n    consolidate the reps back into 3 sets to push the growth further.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> That's working well. While I was doing Mass Made Simple, my bench\r\n    press max double was 135. I can now do that for 5 x 5.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Lower Body/Back (Wednesdays)</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li> deadlift (3x5 | 5x5 | 3x8)\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li> squat (3x5 | 5x5 | 3x8)\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li> crab walk 3 x 45/60\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li> kb snatch 3 x 20\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Upper Body (Mondays &amp; Fridays)</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li> bench press (3x5 | 5x5 | 3x8)\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li> pull-up (3x5 | 5x5 | 3x8)\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li> face pull 3 x 10\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li> front raise 3 x 10\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li> barbell complex (5x5 | 3x8):\r\n        <ul>\r\n            <li> bent row\r\n            </li>\r\n            <li> deadlift\r\n            </li>\r\n            <li> power clean\r\n            </li>\r\n            <li> military press\r\n            </li>\r\n            <li> squat\r\n            </li>\r\n            <li> Romanian deadlift\r\n            </li>\r\n        </ul>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Complementary Work (Saturday)</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li> circuit x 3:\r\n        <ul>\r\n            <li> back extension\r\n            </li>\r\n            <li> axe chop\r\n            </li>\r\n            <li> Jefferson curl\r\n            </li>\r\n            <li> hanging knee raise\r\n            </li>\r\n        </ul>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li> <a href=\"archive/2889\">stretching</a>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Random Notes</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I feel like the <b>crab walks</b> (which I do more in an ice\r\n    skating motion due to space constraints) have been a fantastic\r\n    addition to my workouts. I decided to try that after seeing that\r\n    it was part\r\n    of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJl_xKJ54Xk&t=237s\">Emily\r\n    Batty's</a> gym program.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> And the day of core strength &amp; hip mobility has been great. I\r\n    added the back extensions after\r\n    watching <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOJu7xi3l3Q\">Jeff\r\n    Cavaliere</a> talk about how just doing squats &amp; deadlifts\r\n    is <em>not</em> enough to really build a strong low back.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Together, the crab walks, back extensions, axe chops, and mobilty\r\n    work has <em>massively</em> improved how I feel on standing\r\n    climbs, and improved how my low back feels after tough/long rides.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I find it interesting to note that this has been more effective\r\n    even than\r\n    the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BOTvaRaDjI\">Foundation\r\n    Training low back</a> sequence. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Preliminary Results</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> My measurements are virtually identical to when I finished\r\n    my <a href=\"archive/3402\">hypertrophy block</a> back in November,\r\n    which is great. I'm not trying to add bulk, and I'm not adding\r\n    fat.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I'm comitted to \"playing the long game\", which means moving\r\n    consistently toward those strength targets, and genuinely letting\r\n    go of 2020 and aiming to hit next summer in the best cycling shape\r\n    of my life.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Just the same, I was worried what several months of prioritizing\r\n    strength work would do. Nobody likes to move backward. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> So after taking a rest week and doing a couple of rides to wake up\r\n    my legs, I did a ride\r\n    up <a href=\"https://www.strava.com/segments/7617104\">Coachwhip</a>\r\n    to see where I stand.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Result: I hit my fastest time in nearly a year. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> That's still ~80 seconds off PR pace, but I'm no longer worried\r\n    about losing huge levels of hard-earned bike fitness. I'm\r\n    confident that prioritizing strength over the last few months is\r\n    paying dividends, and I'm on the right track for a great 2021 race\r\n    season.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>What's Next</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> During my late-2019 <a href=\"archive/3402\">hypertrophy block</a>,\r\n    I gained ~10# of muscle. I'd like to now <em>shed</em> ~10# of\r\n    fat, so that I'm back at my 2019 body mass with a much-improved\r\n    composition, and <em>massively</em> better strength. That'll take\r\n    up July &amp; August, and maybe a couple weeks of September.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> And I'm reading up on targeting slow-twitch hypertrophy, so that\r\n    may be on deck for September/October.\r\n</p>\r\n",

    "Intro": "<p> The single best thing I've done for my training this year is to\r\n    build a periodized plan that clarifies priorities, and\r\n    then <em>stick to those priorities</em>. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> And so, here I am reminding myself of my initial principles:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li> clear priorities\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li> play the long game\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p> I've been putting off my fat-loss &amp; base training block. The\r\n    plan is to do what I did last year: shed ~10 lbs by simply\r\n    postponing breakfast until after my 11:00 AM bike ride. Basically,\r\n    I did fasted cardio, and it worked great.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I've been hesitating to implement this because:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n    <li> I like breakfast.\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li> I've given myself the excuse that I need the fuel to make\r\n        sure my rides are productive.\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li> I only have ~12 weeks until my first race. I don't want to\r\n        sacrifice training efficacy to gain weight loss.\r\n    </li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p> This is bullshit. I'm doing some difficult intervals, sure. But\r\n    they're not <em>intense</em> intervals. They're right around my\r\n    lactate threshold. So I don't <em>need</em> the available glucose.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> This week is a back-off week, so I'll let it go. But when I start\r\n    back up next week, it's time to get real about dropping the fat.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I have to remember that it may be 11 weeks until\r\n    the <em>first</em> 6-race OtH series starts, but it's ~22 weeks\r\n    until the <em>second</em> series starts. Fat loss should go early\r\n    in my training (in other words: <em>now</em>). And if I put it off\r\n    until later, I'll just sabotage <em>both</em> series for\r\n    myself. Far, far better to <em>Play the Long Game</em> and focus\r\n    on the genuine top priority in the here-and-now: drop 10 lbs of\r\n    dead weight.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "Intro": "<p> I'm cutting the last week of my planned strength block. My right\r\n    AC joint has been hurting, and I want to focus on getting it\r\n    healed & strong again. I <em>think</em> I tweaked it doing bench\r\n    presses during my hypertrophy block. It's mostly been fine since\r\n    then, but it's been hurting this week and I <em>really</em> want\r\n    it to be solid by the time I start racing.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> So, I feel like that's a solid decision. It's a good time to\r\n    switch my focus to on-bike gains, and put the barbell stuff into\r\n    maintenance/prehab mode.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> But I didn't feel good ending the block on that note... until I\r\n    started looking at the numbers.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n",

I've managed to trim down a bit\r\n    without losing the mass I built during the hypertrophy block. My\r\n    waist got trimmer, I dropped ~4#, and everything else got\r\n    stronger.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Strength</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I feel a bit silly, but I managed to put together a workout that\r\n    made it pretty difficult to quantify progress.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I pushed my deadlift from 165# to 235#. That's pretty clear. But\r\n    box jumps and pull-ups are harder.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I can <em>feel</em> how much stronger the box jumps are. I don't\r\n    have a proper plyo box, so I'm jumping onto a 16'' bench. However,\r\n    over the course of the last 6 weeks, I've jumped from farther and\r\n    farther away onto the bench, and felt stronger and stronger doing\r\n    it.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> And the barbell complex I've been doing now feels like a warm-up\r\n    at 85#. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Ditto for planks, farmer walks, and Jefferson curls. The objective\r\n    loads haven't changed, but the RPE has gotten steadily easier.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> So, I <em>feel</em> really good about the progress I've made, even\r\n    if I can't really quaitify it. The proof will be in how the\r\n    on-bike training shakes out.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> When I started this block, I was noticing a lot of fatigue & some\r\n    discomfort in my low back, and that's now completely gone. (I\r\n    credit the Jefferson curls &amp; farmer walks.)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> And my body weight has dropped from 198# to 194#, so I'm down four\r\n    pounds in 6 weeks, which is <em>fine</em>. (I'm watching my waist\r\n    measurement <em>and</em> my weight, so as long as I'm getting\r\n    leaner, I can deal with the number on the scale not being what I\r\n    planned on.)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Nutrition</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I did <em>not</em> supplement with protein for this block. I added\r\n    more fat than I wanted during\r\n    the <a href=\"archive/3402\">hypertrophy block</a>, and I that got\r\n    in my head a bit. I probably traded some strength gains to get\r\n    leaner, but the strength gains I <em>did</em> make were plenty.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Aside from that, I just kept to my normal diet: minimal sugar,\r\n    protein at breakfast, etc.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Long-Term Goals</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <em>The Cyclist's Training Bible</em> lists target loads for some\r\n    fundamental exercises as a guage of progress:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li> squat: 1.3 - 1.7 x BW\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li> leg press: 2.5 - 2.9 x BW\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li> step-up: 0.7 - 0.9 x BW\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li> seated row: 0.5 - 0.8 x BW\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li> standing row: 0.4 - 0.7 x BW\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p> At the moment, I'm well below those targets. So I've got something\r\n    to shoot for.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n",

So the core of my strength workout is dead simple:\r\n    deadlift, box jump, farmer walk.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>The Workout</h3>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li> warmup: \r\n        <ul>\r\n            <li> kb swing: 20 @ 35#\r\n            </li>\r\n            <li> 1-arm kb swing: 20 @ 35#\r\n            </li>\r\n            <li> kb swing: 20 @ 50#\r\n            </li>\r\n            <li> 1-arm kb swing: 2 x 20 @ 50#\r\n            </li>\r\n        </ul>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li> workout:\r\n        <ul>\r\n            <li> barbell complex (2 sets, 5 reps each movement):\r\n                <ul>\r\n                    <li> bent-over row\r\n                    </li>\r\n                    <li> deadlift\r\n                    </li>\r\n                    <li> clean\r\n                    </li>\r\n                    <li> front squat\r\n                    </li>\r\n                    <li> military press\r\n                    </li>\r\n                    <li> back squat\r\n                    </li>\r\n                    <li> Romanian deadlift\r\n                    </li>\r\n                </ul>\r\n            </li>\r\n            <li> deadlift: 3 x 5\r\n            </li>\r\n            <li> chin-up: 5 x 2 (working toward 3 x 5)\r\n            </li>\r\n            <li> box jump 3 x 10\r\n            </li>\r\n            <li> farmer walk\r\n            </li>\r\n        </ul>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li> assistance/corrective: 3 rounds of:\r\n        <ul>\r\n            <li> plank x 60sec\r\n            </li>\r\n            <li> jefferson curl x 5\r\n            </li>\r\n            <li> resistance band rotator cuff work\r\n            </li>\r\n        </ul>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p> So far, so good. First workout was tough, second felt solid, so I\r\n    increased the weight for the third, and I feel it just right in my\r\n    hips & hams.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I'm doing the barbell work Monday &amp; Thursday, and doing easy\r\n    loops on the bike on Tuesday &amp; Friday. So far, that's working\r\n    well. The bike rides are feeling better and better, and so are the\r\n    barbell sessions, so... success? Or am I just not going hard\r\n    enough in the gym? Dunno. I'll just track my progress and tweak as\r\n    I go.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>The Mental Aspect</h3>\r\n\r\n<p> I took a lot of comfort in doing the <em>Mass Made Simple</em>\r\n    program, because basically none of the decision-making was up to\r\n    me. I could see &amp; feel myself getting stronger, and all I had\r\n    to do was stick with the program.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Putting together my own strength program is far less comfortable.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Honestly, I'm a little stressed at being nearly 20# heavier than I\r\n    was at this time last year, with ~3 monts <em>less</em> time than\r\n    last year before racing starts. That really seems... not good.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> But looking at the calendar, I'm <em>fine</em>. I've got plenty of\r\n    time. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Looking at my records from last year has helped. It really only\r\n    took me about 8 weeks to drop 10#, and if I do that again this\r\n    year, I'll be happy. That would take me back to my racing weight\r\n    last year, with significantly more muscle.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I've backed <em>way</em> off on the protein intake. I've bulked up\r\n    plenty, and I know from experience that I don't need that kind of\r\n    calorie/protein intake to build strength. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>The Big Picture</h3>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li> Priorities, in order:\r\n        <ul>\r\n            <li> gain strength\r\n            </li>\r\n            <li> don't gain any more weight\r\n            </li>\r\n            <li> stretch goal: shed fat\r\n            </li>\r\n        </ul>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li> Barbell Mon/Thr, bike Tue/Fri.\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li> Weigh-in every Friday, with the goal being not\r\n        to <em>gain</em> much. \r\n    </li>\r\n    <li> If I'm not recovered for my barbell work, I'll cut\r\n        intensity/volume on the bike. For now, strenght work takes\r\n        priority.\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p> And with a plan in place, I do feel better. We'll see where I am\r\n    in 8 weeks.\r\n</p>\r\n",

    "Intro": "<h3>The Program</h3>\r\n    \r\n<p> I mostly followed Dan\r\n    John's <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Mass-Made-Simple-Dan-John-ebook/dp/B006HXPR66/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1573691993&sr=8-1\">Mass\r\n    Made Simple</a>, but I'll state up front that I <b>did not do the\r\n    program as written</b>. In particular:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li> I started the program, completed 3 workouts, then got sick &\r\n        continued to do the third workout as a holding pattern until I\r\n        felt solid enough to move forward.\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li> The program recommends a three-day workout rhythm. (Each\r\n        workout is followed by exactly two rest/recharge days.) I\r\n        worked out twice a week. (Usually Monday/Thursday.)\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li> Where the program prescribes <b>bat wings</b>, I did\r\n        flexed-arm hangs, and later chin-ups on a pull-up bar.\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li> The program uses squats at 185# through much of the last few\r\n        weeks. That proved too heavy for me. Where 185# is called for,\r\n        I used 165#.\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p> I found that the workouts took about 90 minutes to complete,\r\n    including a 5-minute warmup of light rowing.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I did <em>not</em> do any stretching to speak of during the\r\n    program, and I have not noticed any diminished mobility.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Results</h3>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Final Tally</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li> 8 canisters of <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0013OWAB4/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1\">protein powder</a>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li> 1 canister <a href=\"https://www.hammernutrition.com/perpetuem\">Perpetuem</a>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li> 200 <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0018OADEA/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1\">creatine capsules</a>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li> 1542 squats\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Measurements</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center\">\r\n<table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\">\r\n    <tr>\r\n        <th>&nbsp</th>\r\n        <th>Before</th>\r\n        <th>After</th>\r\n    </tr>\r\n    <tr>\r\n        <th>weight</th>\r\n        <td>187.2#</td>\r\n        <td>198.2</td>\r\n    </tr>        \r\n    <tr>\r\n        <th>calf</th>\r\n        <td>15.5''</td>\r\n        <td>15.75''</td>\r\n    </tr>        \r\n    <tr>\r\n        <th>thigh</th>\r\n        <td>22.5''</td>\r\n        <td>25.25''</td>\r\n    </tr>        \r\n    <tr>\r\n        <th>hips</th>\r\n        <td>40''</td>\r\n        <td>41''</td>\r\n    </tr>        \r\n    <tr>\r\n        <th>waist</th>\r\n        <td>38''</td>\r\n        <td>39''</td>\r\n    </tr>        \r\n    <tr>\r\n        <th>chest</th>\r\n        <td>39.5''</td>\r\n        <td>42''</td>\r\n    </tr>        \r\n    <tr>\r\n        <th>biceps</th>\r\n        <td>12.5''</td>\r\n        <td>14''</td>\r\n    </tr>        \r\n</table>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> (All measurements taken with\r\n    my <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Sequoia-Fitness-OrbiTape-Body-Measure/dp/B002F7G7SU\">OrbiTape</a>.)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I'd call that a raging success. I haven't gotten results like this\r\n    since I was in my 20's.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n",
    "Body": "<h3>Nutrition</h3>\r\n\r\n<p> I decided to mostly stay off the bike during this block. I wanted\r\n    a break after finishing the local race season, and I found that\r\n    the barbell workouts maxed out my recovery capacity anyway. From a\r\n    purely caloric perspective, the fuel that I was no longer burning\r\n    on the bike was plenty to let me grow some muscle.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Aside from that, I've eliminated sweets from my diet and breakfast\r\n    usually consists of two boiled egg whites and a high-fiber cereal.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Supplements</h3>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Protein:</b> I added 90g of protein to my diet each day. I'd\r\n    have a protein shake with lunch (30g), and one after dinner (60g).\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Here's the recipe:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li> 1 cup almond milk\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li> 1 scoop (30g) protein powder (2 scoops at night)\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li> 1 spoonful of smooth peanut butter\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li> 1 squeeze Hershey's syrup (~2tbsp)\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li> 1 banana\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li> 6 ice cubes\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Creatine:</b> I followed Mass Made Simple's recommendation to\r\n    supplement with ~5g of creatine each day during the program. I\r\n    took it all at once in tablet form with my nightly protein shake,\r\n    and I've experienced no ill effects, and it seems to help with\r\n    recovery between sets, and my ability to do longer sets.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Fish Oil:</b> I continued my normal routine of taking a\r\n    multivitamin tablet and several capsules of fish oil with dinner\r\n    every night.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Subjective Notes</h3>\r\n\r\n<p> I can absolutely feel that I'm stronger than when I started, and\r\n    comparing workouts from the beginning &amp; end of the program\r\n    bears that out.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> During the last two weeks of the program, I <em>definitely</em>\r\n    felt the fatigue accumulating. Once again, it's clear that adequte\r\n    sleep is absolutely key for me. If I slept well, I'd feel good\r\n    about recovering &amp; finishing out the program. If I didn't\r\n    sleep enough (late night, work, dad life), I found my motivation\r\n    &amp; recovery both flagging.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> During the first half of the program, I was drinking 2 protein\r\n    shakes a day, for a total of 60g of protein. That felt like\r\n    enough, but as the workouts got tougher, I started putting 60g of\r\n    protein in my nighttime shake after workouts, and that boosted my\r\n    recovery &amp; muscle gain.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I intentionally did <em>not</em> track my measurements during the\r\n    program, mostly because I didn't want to overthink it. I wanted to\r\n    just do the program as written (as much as possible), and see\r\n    where I ended up. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> As the squats got heavier, I really did feel my posterior chain\r\n    start to work as a single unit. I feel like that's a nice\r\n    progression from the very quad-dominant squat form I had in the\r\n    past.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Before the beginning of the program, I'd been feeling some extra\r\n    fatigue in my low back, and I worried that the sheer volume of\r\n    squatting (and the loads) might be a Bad Idea for me. I maintained\r\n    squat form at all times, and I've felt my low back get\r\n    progressively stronger.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> If I do a similar training block next year, I'll refine my\r\n    nutrition a bit. Now that I know I can put on muscle, I'd like to\r\n    get to a position where I have less fat to shed going into the\r\n    season.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>Looking Ahead</h3>\r\n\r\n<p> In the past, I've made excellent progress in the weight room only\r\n    to find it tough to translate those gains to the bike. I'm going\r\n    to make sure I hold onto whatever gains in work capacity I've\r\n    earned over the last two months.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I've had good results in the past by shifting to a slightly taller\r\n    gear than what feels right. As my legs adapt, I shift again. I'm\r\n    hoping that training like that over the next few months will build\r\n    my ability to push taller gears &amp; move faster.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Whether I repeat this program next season will hinge both on my\r\n    race results and on my body composition when I get\r\n    there. Honestly, I feel like my squat & deadlift numbers are small\r\n    for my size, so I might be better off focusing on strength.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I honestly couldn't be happier with my results. I put on lots of\r\n    muscle & got much stronger. Last year at this time I weighed\r\n    ~186#, so I've got more fat to shed this year than last year. But\r\n    I'm fine with that. If I'm a few pounds heavier that last year,\r\n    pbut I'm a couple of percentage points leaner, I'm happy with\r\n    that.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Long Game Goals</h3>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Fat loss.</b>  I really want to get leaner. So the next\r\n    training block will <em>involve</em> getting my body used to\r\n    spending time on the bike again, but the primary goal will be to\r\n    shed fat.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Strength maintenance.</b> I've pushed up my numbers quite a\r\n    bit, so I want to keep them where they are &amp; <em>start</em> at\r\n    next season's training where I've <em>finished</em> this\r\n    season's. It would be awesome to be able to do this program 100%\r\n    as-written.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "Intro": "<p> I've had a cough for the last couple of weeks. I initially thought\r\n    it was nothing, and just kept training, which felt fine. But it\r\n    held on &amp; got worse rather than better, so I've just stopped\r\n    training altogether &amp; concentrated on getting the rest I\r\n    need.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I'm finally on the mend &amp; expect to be ready to hit the\r\n    weights again on Friday. But I don't want to just jump back in\r\n    where I left off, so I'll be repeating the second week of\r\n    <em>Mass Made Simple</em> before moving forward &amp; completing\r\n    the program.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> A week off, plus repeating a week means I'll be 2 weeks\r\n    behind.

    "Intro": "<p> Even before the last race of the Over the Hump season, I could\r\n    feel that I needed a break. I was looking forward to being able to\r\n    just ride wherever I wanted, <em>if</em> I wanted. And finishing\r\n    5th in that last race, and 7th overall, really made me feel like\r\n    I'd done what I set out to do. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> So what now? Well, it's a good time to take a big-picture look at\r\n    my health &amp; fitness, and to play the game so that I arrive in\r\n    May 2020 stronger, fitter, faster and more injury-proof than I am\r\n    now.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I talked with a nutritionist, who said that I generally eat pretty\r\n    well, and suggested a few improvements to try. I'm trying them.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I've taken a rest week, and I'm now starting to do some light\r\n    barbell work to acclimate my body to that kind of work\r\n    again. (Mostly a modified version of Cosgrove's Evil 8, without\r\n    the power cleans or good mornings.)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I've started Dan\r\n    John's <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Mass-Made-Simple-Dan-John-ebook/dp/B006HXPR66\">Mass\r\n    Made Simple</a> program. It's classic \"bus bench\" stuff: show up,\r\n    do the workout, enjoy the results. The core of the workout is a\r\n    barbell complex (row, clean, front squat, press, back squat, good\r\n    morning) similar to Cosgrove's Evil 8, and a heavy helping of\r\n    squats.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> The first workout went really well, and today I'm definitely sore,\r\n    but not hurting. (I went slightly easy on the complex to make sure\r\n    I had the gas for the squats.) I'll up the weight a bit on the\r\n    complex next time.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> And honestly, I think just a 40-minute complex/squats/pull-up\r\n    workout will be an <em>excellent</em> way to maintain my strength\r\n    gains once I get back on the bike &amp; start base building again\r\n    in a couple of months.\r\n</p>\r\n",

    "Intro": "<p> My final race of the Over the Hump season went <em>really</em>\r\n    well. I managed to hit my personal goal of a top-5 finish, and\r\n    racked up enough points to place 7th overall. I'm\r\n    really happy with that.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> The race this week got off to a much cleaner start than last week,\r\n    though I had to make my way around a guy who lined up on the front\r\n    row, but didn't seem to have the gas to stay near the front at the\r\n    start. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> In the meantime, half a dozen riders had come around me, so I set\r\n    about <em>not</em> burning all my matches on the first punchy\r\n    rise, and making the most of the flat along the lake. I found a\r\n    train &amp; jumped on, and was content to get pulled along, and\r\n    could see that we were passing others in my division. When I did\r\n    pull through, I just kept the same pace &amp; tried to bring the\r\n    rest of the train with me, but it broke apart and I found myself\r\n    alone again on the CX section, which was fine with me.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I grabbed another wheel through the second lap's flat section, and\r\n    actually felt like I'd recovered a bit going into the back half of\r\n    the race. I just concentrated on cornering well and carrying as\r\n    much speed as I could.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I came through the last lap feeling like I had a bit of a gap, but\r\n    knowing that I'd had just a few seconds at <em>best</em> in every\r\n    race so far. I wasn't about to let off the gas.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> The course doubled back on itself several times near the end of\r\n    the lap, so I could see that I had a little bit of a gap going\r\n    into the final 500m or so of the race. But I wasn't about to take\r\n    anything for granted. Nobody behind me for 30m or so was good, but\r\n    no guarantee of anything.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I pushed over the top of the last rise and tried to carry as much\r\n    speed as I could over the pump section. Coming out of the final,\r\n    loose, uphill right-hander before the finish I hit the\r\n    gas <em>hard</em>, and just tried to make sure I didn't give away\r\n    any opportunities at the last moment. If anyone was going to get\r\n    around me, I wanted to at least make them earn it. The only\r\n    thought in my head was, <em>Looking back just makes you slower!\r\n    GO!</em>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> The way things shook out, I earned an overall score I'm fine with,\r\n    hit my goal of a top-5 finish (which I thought wasn't going to\r\n    happen), and have a nice pint glass as a souvenir. That's a pretty\r\n    great way to finish out the season.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Next year, I'll aim to improve on that. But for now, I'm going to\r\n    rest up for a week or two, then hit the weights &amp; start laying\r\n    the groundwork for next year.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n",

    "Intro": "<p> Life got in the way for a couple of weeks, and I missed races #9\r\n    and #10. So it was really fun to be back at the start line this week\r\n    for #11.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Another flat course, another super-fast start. The start was\r\n    hectic, and by the time the field settled I knew the leaders had\r\n    gapped everyone else, and I wasn't sure where I was sitting. So I\r\n    just tried to push and get clear. I've learned to just get away as\r\n    fast as I can without burning out the legs immediately, and that\r\n    worked out okay this week.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> The flat along the lake was early in the lap, and a few riders\r\n    came around me soon after that. (Either on the short, sharp climb\r\n    that ends the flat, or on the CX-style section that followed.) But\r\n    I was able to grab a wheel here and there and hold my pace, and\r\n    managed to pull back a few places on the second lap.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> By the time I hit the flat on the third lap, there was just one\r\n    competitor near me. He tried to pass on the sharp climb after the\r\n    flat, but I got ahead & built a lead on the CX section, and by the\r\n    time I was headed for the finish, I could see I had a comfortable\r\n    gap.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Just the same, I pushed hard through the last climbing S-turn to\r\n    the finish, not wanting a replay of race #7.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> There were <em>lots</em> of trains forming during this race for\r\n    some reason. (I think the course brought the Sport/Elite classes\r\n    together with the Beginner/Intermeditates more than usual.) I\r\n    ended up pulling a few for a while before realizing they were\r\n    behind me.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> So, if I have a note from this week, it's to look for trains to\r\n    jump onto on the flat. The two that I did manage to fall in wich\r\n    picked up my speed by ~2mph, which is a <em>huge</em> energy\r\n    advantage.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> So, ultimately, I had an okay start, held my pace, managed to pick\r\n    up a couple of spots on lap 2, and finished strong.

    "Intro": "<p> Up 5 places! Quite an improvement over last week! \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Before the race, I scoped out the finish and made a mental note of\r\n    the beats: climb, coast, flat, hard left,\r\n    sprint. This <em>really</em> helped at the end of the race when I\r\n    was just about cooked, but knew I had to make the most of that\r\n    coasting section so I'd have something left to push across the\r\n    flat & sprint for the finish.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> The start was the usual drag race off the line, followed by a\r\n    steep, narrow ramp about 200m from the start that created enough\r\n    of a bottleneck that the first guys through basically got the hole\r\n    shot. I didn't get held up <em>too</em> bad, but I didn't exactly\r\n    roll through with any momentum.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> On the fire road climb I just tried to hold an aggressive pace and\r\n    stay with whomever I could, and I <em>especially</em> tried not to\r\n    let myself get stuck behind slower riders. If I could pass without\r\n    redlining, I did.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I think that helped my position going over the top, which ended up\r\n    being pretty close to my finishing place, I think. I have a pet\r\n    theory that if there's just one climb on a course, the order at\r\n    the top is generally the finishing order. That seems to have held\r\n    last night.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> As we started the second lap, I caught up to a competitor in blue,\r\n    and managed to grab onto his wheel.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> We rode like that for a while, then, on the flats headed for the\r\n    last climb, he let me pass and grabbed a wheel a couple of riders\r\n    behind me. I tried to lose him in traffic, but he held on, and\r\n    then made the decisive pass with about 20m left to go on the\r\n    climb. I had no answer, and had to let him go.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> As I was crossing the flat section leading to the finish line, I\r\n    spotted another competitor trying to sneak past, and gave it a bit\r\n    more gas. He was strong, but evidently not <em>quite</em> enough\r\n    to pass, so I was able to hold on for 7th.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> So what went well?\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I was in the right gear & clipped in clean off the starting line.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I was more aggressive about passing slower riders, which I think\r\n    both reduced drag <em>and</em> helped me keep a comfortable\r\n    rhythm.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I managed to mostly avoid getting passed on the last lap. From\r\n    what I can tell, I held my place from the top of the climb to the\r\n    end.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I scoped out the finish, and executed my plan for the end of the\r\n    race.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> And what do I want to do better next week?\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I don't think getting better results is all that complex. I need\r\n    to keep training &amp; get stronger, and I need to start quicker\r\n    off the line. Being near the front after the first few minutes\r\n    bodes <em>really</em> well for a good finish.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> So I'll keep up the interval training, and the strength work I've\r\n    been doing over the last few weeks. \r\n</p>\r\n",

    "Intro": "<p> My recent training is paying\r\n    off <em>huge</em>. My <em>average</em> heart rate last night was\r\n    171bpm, which is nuts.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Temperatures were high, and with very little sustained climbing,\r\n    the pace was murderous. My heart rate jumped straight up above 170\r\n    and stayed there for at least the first 15 minutes, and rarely\r\n    dipped below that. (My <em>average</em> for the race was 171.)\r\n</p>\r\n    \r\n<p> I was sitting 10th until the very last half-mile or so, when I was\r\n    caught by two guys. They both sprinted past me in the final\r\n    seconds of the race to push me back to 12th. I was so cooked that\r\n    even when I realized I was in a bunch headed for the finish line,\r\n    it still didn't register that I should sprint out of the final\r\n    corner to hold them off, and even when they <em>passed</em> me, my\r\n    only thought was to check their leg markings to see if they were\r\n    in my division. Whups... \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I'm pleasantly surprised with how I feel today, after turning\r\n    myself inside-out last night. I'm fatigued, certainly, but I'm not\r\n    the kind of stiff &amp; sore I expected. One more way my trainaing\r\n    has paid off, I supposed.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I have thoughts about what went well, and what didn't. But\r\n    ultimately, it's clear that if I want to move up in the field,\r\n    I simply have to get stronger &amp; leaner. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I was told recently that I'm too big (frame, not fatness) for\r\n    cycling, but mountain biking is the realm of speedy gorillas. So\r\n    many guys in the field are built like power lifters. So my near-\r\n    to long-term training goals are to drop the rest of this excess\r\n    fat I'm carrying around, and add some serious muscle.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> But for now, the name of the game is to get out and do the rest of\r\n    my training for this week, and then recover &amp; prep for next\r\n    week's race.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "Intro": "<p> I'm done numbering the weeks. Tahoe is off, and The Grizzly 100 is\r\n    at the end of September. That's close enough that I need to start\r\n    thinking about it, but today's not about that.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I just wrapped up the second block of Strava TCTP training, and\r\n    the results have been great.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I\r\n    used <a href=\"https://www.strava.com/segments/7617104\">Coachwhip</a>\r\n    as my fitness test. I've been chasing a new PR there for\r\n    a <em>long</em> time, and it's a sustained 10-minute dirt climb\r\n    close to home. My litmus test for the Strava program was: <em>Can\r\n    this restore forward progress to my Coachwhip PRs?</em>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Answer: <em>Hell yes.</em>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> The first training block improved my time from 9:25 to 9:12, good\r\n    enough for a new PR.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> The second block got me down to <b>8:53</b>, which I'm really\r\n    pleased with. I've been trying to get under 9:00 for ages.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Two months of training took <em>32 seconds</em> off a 9-minute\r\n    climb. That's damn fine progress.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> And across the board, I'm improving. My endurance is up, I'm\r\n    holding my HR at 170BPM on my hill repeats (up from 165 or so) and\r\n    I'm recovering from workouts really well.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Interesting sidenote: I've noticed in the past that I need to\r\n    \"wake up\" my legs before I can perform at my best. I initially\r\n    attempted a PR after a day of easy riding and a rest day, and was\r\n    way, way off the pace.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I went back the very next day, and was <em>40 seconds</em> faster\r\n    to score that 8:53 PR.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I can't help thinking of the Limestone Canyon race, where I felt\r\n    sluggish. It was the same pattern: a day of easy riding, a day of\r\n    rest, then race. For my next race or PR attempt, I'll do some\r\n    riding the day before and see how that feels.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n",

    "Intro": "<p> I lined up on Saturday morning for\r\n    the <a href=\"archive/3390\">Limestone Canyon race</a>. I've\r\n    resolved to race more often in 2019, and with Tahoe off the table,\r\n    I've been looking for smaller, closer options. Limestone certainly\r\n    fit the bill.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> A peek at the course map and a bit of Google satellite imagery\r\n    magic was nearly as good as a pre-ride. I printed out a little\r\n    cheat sheet that combined course cues with a tactical plan:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<table>\r\n    <tr>\r\n        <td>START</td>\r\n        <td>GO!</td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n    <tr>\r\n        <td>1.5</td>\r\n        <td>MOVE</td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n    <tr>\r\n        <td>1.9</td>\r\n        <td>CLIMB</td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n    <tr>\r\n        <td>4.0</td>\r\n        <td>RIDGE - 2 KICKERS</td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n    <tr>\r\n        <td>5.1</td>\r\n        <td>DESCEND</td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n    <tr>\r\n        <td>8.2</td>\r\n        <td>SHORT CLIMB</td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n    <tr>\r\n        <td>8.4</td>\r\n        <td>RIDGE</td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n    <tr>\r\n        <td>10.0</td>\r\n        <td>GO GO GO</td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n<p> I <em>hoped</em> I'd need the tactical info, but honestly I know\r\n    where I stand in the Sport class pecking order. Just the same, it was\r\n    really nice to have that on my top tube out on the course as a way\r\n    to measure my efforts, and especially to know when to expect\r\n    turns, climbs, etc.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> It was clear from the map that there were basically two key points\r\n    on the course. I figured that at mile 5.1, where the major\r\n    climbing topped out, whoever was out front would probably stay\r\n    there. And the best opportunity to be ahead at mile 5.1 would to\r\n    go to the riders at the front when the fire road funneled onto\r\n    singletrack at mile 2.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> So the funnel onto singletrack would be the first selection, and\r\n    the last two climbs on the ridge would be the second.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> So I wasn't surprised when the race organizers told everyone at\r\n    the start of the race: \"Get your passing done by mile 2.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I mentally prepped for a lung-busting start, and hoped that the\r\n    relatively flat singletrack to the first climb would provide a\r\n    chance to breathe &amp; find a sustainable rhythm.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Someone yelled, \"GO!\" and we were off.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I clipped in clean, and headed onto the fire road sitting top\r\n    10(-ish?), and tried to spin my way into solid position.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I don't think I was ruthless enough in passing. Several times, I\r\n    let gaps form a wheel or two ahead of me, and had to catch the\r\n    wheels of passing riders to get around, rather than pushing around\r\n    myself. That <em>might</em> be smart racing (maybe?), but it felt\r\n    like I was falling farther and farther back.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I'm reminded of a line from Sean Yates's book: \"The field is going\r\n    to split, and you're in the wrong half. MOVE UP.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> By the time I hit the singletrack, I was sitting <em>maybe</em>\r\n    top 15, felt, race stupid and my legs were toast. I figured the\r\n    leaders were well up the trail and <em>maybe</em> I was hanging\r\n    onto the back of the second group. I knew I'd have nothing left\r\n    for the ridgeline if I didn't get my HR down, so I dropped a\r\n    couple of gears, and tried to spin my way up the climb as easily\r\n    as I could.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> By the time I reached the ridgeline, I knew dialing back the\r\n    intensity was a good call, but I also had no idea if there was\r\n    anyone left behind me. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> At that point, I got into the headspace that works for me in this\r\n    situation: If there <em>is</em> anyone benind me, I want to hold\r\n    them off. And if anyone ahead crumbles or has a mechanical, I want\r\n    to be in position to capitalize. So I pushed on.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Right on cue at mile 5, the trail started down, and I let the bike\r\n    run. It was <em>really</em> nice to be able to push over the top\r\n    knowing I'd have a long descent to recover.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I passed a few riders on the way down through the canyon. One or\r\n    two were completely shattered, granny-gearing it home, and most\r\n    were coasting. In the past, the flats have been where I felt\r\n    extremely weak, but I found that my recent training was doing me\r\n    good. I didn't feel <em>powerful</em>, but I certainly had the gas\r\n    to hold a fast pace down through the canyon, which was satisfying.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> The final, short climb up to the ridgeline singletrack went easily\r\n    enough. The trail was <em>far</em> more groomed than anything\r\n    earlier in the course, which was nice, but I was well aware that I\r\n    could push <em>too</em> hard, or I'd detonate.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> The ridgeline singletrack was... not that much fun. It was loose\r\n    and rocky, and several little downhills had become rutted, narrow\r\n    funnels full of loose gravel. Throw in big prickly pear cacti here\r\n    and there, and I found myself worrying far more about not getting\r\n    hurt than about going fast.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Once I hit the fire road at mile 10, I just hit the gas and made\r\n    sure to hold off anyone who might be close behind. I took a couple\r\n    of looks behind me, didn't see anyone, and knew I'd probably be\r\n    fine if I just held my pace.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> The coast stayed clear all the way to the finish line. Final\r\n    place: 9th out of 13 in Sport Men 36-49.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> That's... pretty much what I expected. I was hoping for a solid\r\n    mid-pack finish, but I felt like I rode better than I expected,\r\n    and I see what I need to do to prep for future races.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> First, I need to get leaner. I'm just carrying around <em>way</em>\r\n    too much fat to be competitive. The single most obvious difference\r\n    between the Beginners and the top of the Sport class is their body\r\n    makup. Lots of bellies in the Beginners and slower Sport riders\r\n    (myself included). <em>Zero</em> excess body weight on the podium.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Second, I need to continue the structured training I've been doing. I\r\n    felt <em>so</em> much better after this race than any other race\r\n    I've done, and I felt like I was <em>much</em> stronger later in\r\n    the race than I would have been a few months ago.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> And third, any prep for future races needs to simulate the classic\r\n    local XC race start: 2 miles of fast fire road followed by steep\r\n    singletrack climbing.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> But I did a little number crunching, and I feel like moving up to\r\n    a top-5 finish next year is doable. With a 1:05:00 finish, I was\r\n    just 8 minutes off the podium, and just 10 minutes behind the\r\n    winner. That's a big chunk of time, but getting 10 minutes faster\r\n    on this course over the next year or so feels doable, and the math\r\n    checks out. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Basically, extrapolating from my recent efforts on Coachwhip, I\r\n    might be able to take a minute off my lap time each month. If I do\r\n    that every month for a year, I'm on the podium. If I do\r\n    any <em>more</em> than that, I win.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> That definitely feels like something worth working\r\n    for. I'd <em>love</em> to come back next year and post a top-5\r\n    finish or better.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> So, today I did my endurance miles, and tomorrow it's\r\n    intervals. The work continues...\r\n</p>\r\n",

I can feel that there's\r\n    a <em>much</em> more solid transfer of power from the pedals\r\n    through the rear wheel.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I also took my road bike to the local bike shop for a tune-up, and\r\n    they did a <em>fantastic</em> job. It's noticeably\r\n    smoother. Unfortunately, I think the shifters are finally starting\r\n    to give out after 13 years, so it may be time for a new groupset\r\n    soon. I only ever use my road bike for training rides, so I'm\r\n    going to just make do for the time being and keep my eyes peeled\r\n    for a bargain.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Poised for New PRs</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I rode up Coachwhip for the first time in ages this week, and\r\n    posted a time just 6 seconds shy of my PR, and faster by far than\r\n    I've been in more than 2 years. It's chafes a bit that I've had to\r\n    work this hard to get back to where I was a few years back, but so\r\n    be it. I'm hear, and there's nothing but open road ahead.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>What Now?</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Unfortunately, I have some kind of chest cold that's making it\r\n    tough to really go full throttle. I have to respect the need to\r\n    rest and get healthy. But I'm also in sort of a golden moment at\r\n    work where my schedule allows me to ride more than usual, and I\r\n    don't want to miss that opportunity. So I'm holding myself back\r\n    just a little, and we'll see how I feel next week.\r\n</p>\r\n",

I didn't get\r\n    in <em>all</em> the rides I wanted, but the final tally was solid\r\n    nontheless.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> This week's checklist:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li> Hard climb three days: <b>check!</b>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li> Ride 3+ hrs: <b>check!</b> (3:56)\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li> Drop a pound: <b>Nope.</b>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p> My weight held steady at <b>182.6#</b>. Stress at work saw me\r\n    stuffing down a few extra cookies this week, and my usual routine\r\n    of skipping breakfast &amp; eating <em>after</em> my ride hasn't\r\n    been consistent. So I'm honestly not surprised that I haven't\r\n    dropped any more weight.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> This week, I'll get everything dialed back in, and hopefully get\r\n    my weight under 180# in the next couple of weeks.\r\n</p>\r\n",

But it left me hungry for some time on the bike.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I've found that the neighborhood horse trails stand up just fine\r\n    in the rain, so I did a little exploring this week, with the aim\r\n    of adding more dirt to my loop through Wallnut.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I discovered that the bike path along the creek is open all the\r\n    way east from the office past Fairway, <em>and</em> that there's a\r\n    tunnel under Valley Blvd that connects to the Lemon Creek Trail,\r\n    and finally out to S Lemon Ave.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> That opens up a whole new route for days I don't want to do a lot\r\n    of climbing, which is <em>awesome.</em> And I just love \"ally cat\"\r\n    rides that link a series of little-used, non-obvious routes. To\r\n    me, they're just as interesting as any trail ride.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> So, the rain seems to be passing, and I'm feeling great. Where am\r\n    I at now?\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li> <b>Weight:</b> I've maintained my weight at <b>182.2#</b>, so\r\n        my weight loss efforts will pick up next week right where I left\r\n        off.\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li> <b>Training:</b> I've logged about <b>3:00</b> of saddle time\r\n        in the last two weeks, which puts me at roughly 40% of my\r\n        normal volume.

This week, as planned, I popped up a gear, and I've started\r\n    doing the Skyline climb two gears up from my granny.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> On Monday, the goal was just to get my workout, not implode, and\r\n    see how that felt. It felt fine. So today I pushed the pace.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I finished just 6 seconds off PR. And the graph above is kind of\r\n    bananas. All the places where I was crushing my old pace were the\r\n    steep climbs. All the sections where I was falling back were the\r\n    relatively easy stretches where I was a little spun out and\r\n    catching my breath.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> If I just match my old PR pace on the flats, I'll take about 30 seconds off my time.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> And when my legs get stronger and I'm spinning the new gear at the\r\n    same cadence as the old one, I'll be even faster than that.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> So that's good news. How did the checklist shake out?\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Drop a Pound: Nope</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li> Last Week: <b>182.4#</b>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li> This Week: <b>182.0#</b>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p> I weighed in on Thursday instead of waiting until Saturday morning, so that tilted the scales against me.

I also suspect that I simply had too many\r\n    sweets this week. I <em>was</em> having a single break &amp; bake\r\n    cookie with lunch, but I didn't get a chance to bake those this\r\n    week, so I've been eating the cookies from the cafe at work. I\r\n    think they probably count double, maybe tripple.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> And I had a helping of my mom's leftover birthday cake on\r\n    Wednesday, which I'm sure didn't help.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I'd <em>love</em> to believe that I'm putting on a bit of muscle\r\n    from the tough climbing I've been doing, but I know that's most\r\n    likely not the case.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> This week is Thanksgiving, so I expect it'll be tough to really\r\n    stay on the straigh &amp; narrow, but I'll do my best to at least\r\n    avoid <em>gaining</em>.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Ride 3+ hours: Check!</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Finally tally: 3:47 hrs, 3930 ft, 44.8 mi.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Clean & lube bike: Mostly.</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> The problem from <a href=\"archive/3373\">a couple weeks ago</a>\r\n    returned on Thursday with a vengeance. I noticed the freehub\r\n    catching a little bit early in my lunchtime ride, but it was fine\r\n    as long as I was pedaling, so I decided I'd get my workout and\r\n    deal with the problem when I got home.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Unfortunately, the innocuous catching got more serious, and\r\n    eventually (I still don't really understand how) the missing link\r\n    on my chain popped, leaving me chainless.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Luckily, the chain caught in my rear derailleur, so I didn't have\r\n    to go back and hunt for it. A few minutes of fiddling with a\r\n    replacement link had me moving again, but I had to baby the bike\r\n    all the way back to the office.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I didn't have time Thursday night to repair the rear wheel on my\r\n    mountain bike, which forced me into some road exploration. I've\r\n    been driving some of the roads south of City of Industry on my way\r\n    to work each morning, so it was fun to finally get to ride a few\r\n    of them.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Still, my heart really is in trail riding. So I swapped out the\r\n    bearings in my rear hub for new ones on Friday after work, and did\r\n    some general maintenance on Sunday night. I'm all set to ride.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Unfortunately, wrenching didn't leave a lot of time for cleaning, so while my drive train is shiny, the rest of the bike needs a bit of love. I'll try to get that in this week.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Weight Loss Goals</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I'm steadily dropping weight, and that's awesome. My goal is to\r\n    get under 180 lbs, and I'm just a few pounds away from that.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> My <em>stretch</em> goal here is to get under 175 lbs. If I do\r\n    that, I've promised myself something nice. (New jacket/jersey,\r\n    etc.) I havce my eye on a jacket from Twin Six, but I may change\r\n    my mind.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Next Week's Checklist</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li> Don't gain weight\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li> Ride 3+ Hours\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p> It's Thanksgiving.

    "Intro": "<p> The third week of Tahoe Trail 100 training is in the books.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Drop a Pound: Check!</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Check!\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li> Last week's weigh-in: 190.2 lbs\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li> This week's weigh-in: 187.6 lbs\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p> I'm skeptical that I'm genuinely dropping weight that fast, but\r\n    the consistent downward trajectory is great.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Ride 3+ Hours: Check!</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Logged 3:50 hrs &amp; 3800 ft of climbing this week, and set a PR\r\n    on the big climb I've been doing, so I'm happy.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I felt <em>super</em> tired on Thursday, but recovered really well\r\n    last night and was looking forward to today's ride. But dad life\r\n    forced that to the back burner. Still, solid week of training,\r\n    especially if I can sneak out for a cool morning road ride over\r\n    the weekend.    \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Plan a Benchmark Ride: Check!</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I've put together a loop in Chino Hills State Park that's about 19\r\n    miles with 2800 ft. of climbing. Three solid climbs with plenty of\r\n    little punchy stuff mixed in, if I remember Chino right. The next\r\n    order of business is to make time to go <em>ride</em> this loop.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>What's Next?</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Over all, this week went really well. More of the same for a\r\n    couple more weeks, then I ramp up the climbing a bit.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I've also mapped out a loop in Big Bear that I'm really itching to\r\n    ride. The research that I've done says it's basically useless to\r\n    try to train <em>for</em> altitude unless you can\r\n    train <em>at</em> altitude for 3 weeks or so. That's not going to\r\n    happen.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Still, I really do need to establish a steady rhythm of 3hr+ rides\r\n    between now and July, and doing a few at altitude will at least be\r\n    educational. Maybe I'll burn a vacation day and go do that some\r\n    weekday in the spring once the trails are rideable.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> And there's a problem with my freehub that's causing it to rotate\r\n    with the wheel once in a while when I'm coasting. At first I\r\n    thought it was the bearings again, but they're fine. So I'm going\r\n    to give the freehub a good cleaning and see if that resolves it\r\n    for good.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>This week's checklist:</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li> Clean &amp; lube freehub\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li> Drop a pound\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li> Ride 3+ hrs\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li> Schedule a vacation day in the Spring to ride the Skyline Trail\r\n        in Big Bear.\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n",

I'll keep an eye on things and see\r\n    where the numbers settle.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Training is going <em>great</em>. I have <em>three</em> solid 10-\r\n    to 15-minute trail climbs reachable from where I'm working:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li> <a href=\"https://www.strava.com/segments/6107334\">Switchback Climb</a>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li> <a href=\"https://www.strava.com/segments/2664747\">Skyline the Hard Way</a>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li> <a href=\"https://www.strava.com/segments/8033829?filter=overall\">Switchbacks to Radio Towers</a>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p> <em>Skyline the Hard Way</em> is the toughest of the bunch, so I'm\r\n    taking my time mixing that in. I plan on doing it twice a week for\r\n    four weeks, then alternate twice-a-week and three-times-a-week for\r\n    a month, then do three-times-a-week for a month. I'm hoping\r\n    that'll be about when I've hit my target weight/body fat %, so\r\n    I'll make a decision then about how to proceed.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I've put together a rough training plan. I want to spend the next\r\n    couple of months focused on shedding fat while keeping\r\n    muscle. After that, I'll continue to watch my diet, but I'll be\r\n    fueling harder training rides, and eating to recover.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I looked at a few rides from my past, but they all have <em>too\r\n        much</em> climbing to make a decent comparison to the TT100. And\r\n    the local rides I've considered have to <em>little</em>.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> So I'm considering taking a day off work in the next couple of\r\n    months to go back to the Santa Monicas, where long climbs are\r\n    plentiful, and do a loop around Backbone or something. A 30mi ride\r\n    with about 3500ft of climbing should give me a clear idea of where\r\n    I'm at.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> In the meantime, I'm going to do a little Strava stalking and see\r\n    if there's anyone near me that has completed the TT100 and has\r\n    done a few of the same local loops/climbs as me.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>This Week's Checklist:</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li> Drop a pound\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li> Ride 3+ hrs\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li> Plan a benchmark ride that mimics the TT100's climbing/distance ratio\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n",

    "Intro": "<p> I've officially started preparations for\r\n    the <a href=\"http://www.tahoetrailmtb.com/\">Tahoe Trail\r\n    100</a>. First item of business: get to my longtime target weight\r\n    under 180 lbs, at 12-14% body fat. (As measured by my unreliable\r\n    bathroom scale.)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Last week's weigh-in:</b> 194.8 lbs.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>This week's weigh-in:</b> 194.0 lbs.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I'm gonna call that a win. Basically, I ate my first meal of the\r\n    day <em>after</em> my first workout of the day, I ate home-cooked\r\n    food for nearly all my meals, and I cut my desert intake in\r\n    half. Aside from that, my food intake changed very little from\r\n    normal.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I'm hoping I can make steady progress over the next few months\r\n    (yes, even through the holidays), which should put me under 180\r\n    lbs in about four months. That leaves four months to eat for\r\n    recovery rather than weight loss, and be ready for the Tahoe Trail\r\n    100.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Since the first steps were so clear, I haven't bothered yet, but\r\n    at some point I'll sit down and work out a target time and a\r\n    training calendar and plot out the milestones I need to hit.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I'm reminded of an exchange I saw on <em>Billions</em>. It went\r\n    something like:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n    <p> \"Nobody at your stage in the game has master plan to get <em>there</em>.\"\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p> \"Nobody who gets there doesn't.\"\r\n    </p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p> I'll have to work backward from July 13, figure out my taper, and\r\n    work out some kind of target time.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Honestly, my first and only <em>real</em> goal is to participate\r\n    in and finish the race. Logistically and athletically, that'll be\r\n    a pretty great day.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> But it'll help my motivation in training to have a target time in\r\n    place, and a plan to achieve it. And it'll help my motivation\r\n    during the race to know I've trained well and have every\r\n    expectation of finishing.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> So. Final score for this week:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li> Drop a pound: check.\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li> Ride 3+ hrs: check\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p> Checklist for next week:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li> Drop a pound\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li> Ride 3+ hrs\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li> Sketch out a training calendar\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li> Plan benchmark ride that mimics TT100's climbing/distance ratio\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n",

And the fun\r\n    downhill is thin, covered in braking bumps, and washed out on the\r\n    outside of all the turns.

    "Intro": "<p> The stars aligned this week: I had time, health, and a working\r\n    bike, all at the same time. I rode <em>every day</em> this week.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> It's amazing what having a working, top-shelf fork can do for the\r\n    quality of a ride. My new Fox Float 32 Factory fork\r\n    is <em>awesome</em>. Little ripples and bumps disappear, and big\r\n    ones are manageable. Utterly confidence-inspiring. So, so much\r\n    better than the mushy, stiction-afflicted mess that was my old\r\n    Marzocchi.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I spent the first part of the week retracing familiar trails and\r\n    getting re-accustomed to real trail riding. So I focused on the\r\n    Yucca downhill (new PR), Grasshopper (ditto), and tried to make\r\n    sure each ride included plenty of climbing, just to get that into\r\n    my legs while I have the chance.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> And Friday afternoon, I decided not to sweat the pace, and instead\r\n    just explore what else I could find close to home. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I ended up riding some of the trails through Anaheim Hills. A bit\r\n    of singletrack along the creek, and some horse trails, but all of\r\n    it enjoyable. (Some of it simply because it's new, some because\r\n    it's genuinely great.)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> It's a near-perfect one-hour loop starting from the Weir Canyon\r\n    trailhead at the end of Hidden Canyon Rd. and looping east through\r\n    Weir, then connecting out to the neighborhood trails through\r\n    Anaheim Hills. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> The singletrack running south from Blue Sky Rd is genuinely\r\n    great. What a gem to find hidden in a suburban neighborhood. And\r\n    it was fun to connect Deer Canyon to other trails. Without those\r\n    connections, it's just an isolated out-and-back. Now I can link it\r\n    with neighborhood horse trails, and back to Weir.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I've always been a huge fan of hidden neighborhood trails/loops,\r\n    especially if they involve little secrets you only discover by\r\n    actually exploring what's there. This loop ticks all the\r\n    boxes. About an hour, 1300 ft of climbing, some fun singletrack,\r\n    some challenging technical climbing, and enough navigation to keep\r\n    my mind engaged. I'm <em>absolutely</em> going to go back and ride\r\n    this again when I get the chance.\r\n</p>\r\n",

    "Intro": "<p> Lots and lots of work on my mountain bike lately. I'm sure nobody\r\n    cares but me, but just so I have notes somewhere, here's the rundown.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n",
    "Body": "<p> <b>Fork: Fox Float 32 Factory 29er</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> My Marzocchi has been on its last legs for years, so when I\r\n    spotted a closeout deal on a top of the line Fox, I jumped on it.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> The first shake-out ride definitely felt weird, and I was worried\r\n    that I'd bought a fork that was radically unsuited to my\r\n    frame. But the geometry on the Fox is pretty close to the\r\n    Marzocchi, so I was skeptical that a few mm here and there could\r\n    add up to what I was feeling.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I made some adjustments, did another short, easy ride, and\r\n    something was definitely still not right. So I got out the tools\r\n    and got down to business.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> There was a little play at the crown, and some really noticeable\r\n    stickiness when turning the bars. It <em>felt</em> nearly\r\n    identical to when I first got my bike,\r\n    and <a href=\"archive/2575\">put the headset together\r\n    incorrectly</a>. So I pulled everything apart, and discovered that\r\n    I'd forgotten to install the crown race. Doh.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I fixed my mistake, and everything feels <em>much</em> better.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Rear Bearings</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> The bearings in my rear hub were complaining, so I decided to\r\n    replace them with the spares I bought <a href=\"archive/3310\">last\r\n        time</a>.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Unfortunately, my improvised bearing press damaged the new\r\n    bearings on the way in. (Hardly surprising.) When I turned the\r\n    axle it felt like it was dipped in crunchy peanut butter. Bah.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> So I ordered new bearings and a set of <a href=\"http://a.co/8MGyJ4u \">over-axle drift\r\n    adapters</a>. Still kind of half-assed, but it worked well enough.\r\n    The whole thing went together nice and smooth, and the rear wheel\r\n    is now spinning perfectly.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Stan's Rim Tape</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> A couple of <a href=\"archive/3361\">flats</a> lately damaged the\r\n    rim tape on my rear wheel to the point where it simply wasn't\r\n    holding air any more. So I bit the bullet, ordered the tape, and\r\n    replaced the tape that came installed with the wheels.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> The wheel is losing air between rides, so I clearly did an\r\n    imperfect job. But it's holding plenty well enough to ride\r\n    on. When I have the time &amp; energy, I'll take another crack at\r\n    taping the rim.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>New GPS Mount</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> In the course of monkeying with my bars, I managed to break my\r\n    Barfly 3.0 GPS mount. The Barfly 4.0 is every bit as terrible as\r\n    the 3.0 is wonderful. (Heavier, bulkier, requires a shim for my\r\n    bars.)  So I've opted for a Sram Quickview mount, which is\r\n    basically the same as the old Barfly.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Saddle: Ergon SMR-3 Comp</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I bought\r\n    an <a href=\"https://ergonbike.myshopify.com/products/smr3-comp\">Ergon\r\n    SMR-3 Comp</a> to replace my <a href=\"archive/3359\">busted\r\n    saddle</a>. The front is narrower than my old saddle, and the back\r\n    is wider, so... yeah. Still forming an opinion.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Rear Brake</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I'd noticed my rear brake was rubbing a bit on the rotor. Further\r\n    inspection revealed that the pads weren't retracting evenly. So I\r\n    set about to bleed the brake &amp; get everything humming again.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Unfortunately, attempting to unscrew the top bleed port stripped\r\n    the torx nut. And attempting to make half-assed adjustments via\r\n    the bottom bleed port just left me with a brake that needed fluid\r\n    and <em>still</em> wasn't retracting evenly.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> And that's where I finally said uncle. I'm gonna have some time\r\n    next week to <em>either</em> ride <em>or</em> wrench, but not\r\n    both, especially if I can't make the repairs myself. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Hitting the Trail</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I'm really looking forward to getting out for a ride next\r\n    week. We'll see how that goes. Most of the time I've spent with my\r\n    bike over the last couple of weeks has been spent wrenching. I'm\r\n    really looking forward to actually enjoying the benefits of all\r\n    these upgrades and repairs. It's fun to tinker, but I'm so, so\r\n    ready to forget about the details and just ride.\r\n</p>\r\n",

A <em>real</em> ride, on <em>actual\r\n    trails.</em>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I picked a smallish loop that took me down Yucca Ridge.

    "Intro": "<p> <b>What went well?</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I think I've finally mentally adapted to the lack of cycling\r\n    time. My rides\r\n    are <a href=\"http://danjohn.net/2012/01/but-this-is-how-i-know-you-didnt-do-it/\">punch-the-clock\r\n    workouts</a>, and I'm measuring progress by how I'm doing in the\r\n    gym, where training time is less restrictive. (Doing okay at an\r\n    Over the Hump race certainly helped with this.)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> My workout routine is consistent, and workouts now include basics\r\n    I used to neglect, like running, chin-ups/pull-ups, loaded\r\n    carries, and stretching.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> My lunchtime rides are <em>far</em> higher-quality than they were\r\n    eight weeks ago. I'm riding my trail bike more than my road bike,\r\n    and my regular loop includes plenty of fire-road-style dirt, which\r\n    is a <em>massive</em> upgrade that I'm not sure would have\r\n    happened without a conscious decision to seek out better routes.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I <a href=\"archive/3342\">raced</a>, and even performed reasonably\r\n    well. That was <em>not</em> a simple thing to put together, and I\r\n    don't think it would have happened without really focusing on\r\n    concrete next steps.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>What went badly?</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> My weight is the same as it was 8 weeks ago. I can see in the\r\n    mirror that I'm adding muscle, and I'm noticeably stronger in the\r\n    gym, so I'm not <em>too</em> upset. But still, I know that the\r\n    single best thing I can do for my fitness is to get my body fat\r\n    down around 12%. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Bringing lunch to work will require me to make changes to my\r\n    weekly routine. I can't just \"try to find something\" on weekday\r\n    mornings. I've got to shop ahead of time, and do the prep over the\r\n    weekend.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Take-Aways</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> One pattern that emerged is that if I'm not making progress toward\r\n    a goal, I need to break it down into smaller pieces that\r\n    I <em>can</em> execute.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> What's <em>not</em> obvious about this is that a single, all-day,\r\n    high-priority task might be one item on the to-do list. \"Clean\r\n    garage,\" for instance, might be one item\r\n    <em>if</em> I plan to start after breakfast on Saturday morning\r\n    and continue until it's completely done. On the other hand, if I\r\n    know that I'm only going to have one-hour chunks of time to work\r\n    on the garage, then I'm going to break down \"Clean Garage\" into\r\n    30- to 60-minute tasks. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Doing okay in the Over the Hump race quieted my worries that my\r\n    on-bike training isn't enough. It gave me the confidence to just\r\n    keep my focus on general strength and conditioning work, and on\r\n    losing fat. If anything, I know I need to turn up the\r\n    intensity <em>in the gym</em>, and if I'm going to tweak any part\r\n    of my bike training, it should be to add short, sharp\r\n    climbs. (30-60 seconds, as steep as I can find.)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> And, honestly, I think the notion of having one or two achievable\r\n    weekly goals works really well for me. So I'll keep doing\r\n    that. But not with the intensity I have been, and not directed at\r\n    fitness or cycling.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> For the next couple of weeks, my mental energy needs to be focused\r\n    on executing at work. So that's my self-coaching \"goal\" for the\r\n    time being.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n",

The little one is back on a more reasonable schedule the\r\n    last few days, so here's hoping that last week was, as they\r\n    say, <em>just a phase.</em>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Do some loaded carries.</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Check. Did some farmer walks with 45# dumbbells in the gym. This\r\n    week I'll do the same, and today (Monday) I did a workout on the\r\n    patio, and turned carying my kettlebells outside into part of the\r\n    workout. (So, KB farmer walk 2 x 40m @85#)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Overall: D</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I think I've hit the limit on improvements I can make to my\r\n    fitness routine without also making changes in the rest of my\r\n    life. And there, other things take priority.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I think I'm going to give the self-coaching routing a break for a\r\n    while after week 8. I've made a lot of progress in a short time,\r\n    and now it's time to let that solidify for a while.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Goals for Week 8</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li> Get back on track with the sweets. (Already making\r\n        progress there.)\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li> Do two deadlift sessions.\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p> And that's it. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n",

    "Intro": "<p> The other riders clued me in at the lineup: the course was\r\n    different from last week. Three laps, not two, and no big climb. I\r\n    wasn't sure what to do about that, so I just went with my goal of\r\n    starting strong and hanging with the lead pack as long as I could.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <a href=\"http://results.replaytiming.com/Results.aspx?CId=16561&RId=78&EId=7\">Results</a> (<a href=\"attachments/08152017-results.csv\">DMG copy</a>)\r\n</p>\r\n",
    "Body": "<p> That turned out well for me. The guys at the front controlled the\r\n    pace for the first quarter mile or so before opening up a bit when\r\n    we hit dirt. The field would spread out and come back together as\r\n    we negotiated a few side trails east of the start/finish area.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I was <em>with</em> the lead group, but I could see that I was\r\n    working harder than them. Then we hit the asphalt leading out the\r\n    gravel access road, and they hit the gas. I tried to go, but\r\n    simply didn't have it. Wasn't even a question. The field split,\r\n    and I did my best to mark my position. It seemed like about 7 guys\r\n    ahead, and maybe 3 behind? I wasn't sure.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> The first and second laps get kind of hazy after that. I just\r\n    tried to keep the pressure on, not overcook the rises, make the\r\n    most of the downhills, and pass efficiently where I could. I took\r\n    mental notes about where I could coast without losing position,\r\n    and where bunch-ups were happening.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I do rememember getting passed by a kid (might have been 14 or\r\n    so?) on one of the climbs. \"Good job!\" he said as he went by. So,\r\n    so great. One of the things that impressed me the most about this\r\n    event was how involved all the kids were, and how positive the\r\n    vibe was around them. I really hope I can share something like\r\n    this with my daughter when she's ready.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> On the third lap, I caught a rider in blue on the gravel road. I\r\n    tucked in behind him for a minute, trying to relax get ready for\r\n    the quick climb coming up. His pace flagged for a few seconds, so\r\n    I pulled around and tried to open a gap.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> That mostly worked, but we came back together on the short rise at\r\n    the end of the fire road, and a rider in green came around and got\r\n    ahead of us on the doubletrack.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> The three of us leapfrogged for a few minutes, then I managed to\r\n    pass them both on the wide climb after the doubletrack, and keep\r\n    the pressure on to the top of the downhill. I was definitely\r\n    spending the rest of my matches, but there was nothing left to\r\n    save them for anyway. The course was super-fast from the last\r\n    downhill to the finish, so I figured I might be able to hold them\r\n    off if I cranked the downhill and held my speed.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> The guy in blue was on my ass the whole time, which gave me the\r\n    adrenline kick I needed to stay on the gas.  But in the end it\r\n    worked-- I held out for 9th place, Blue took 10th, and the guy in\r\n    green ended up about 10 seconds back in 11th.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> The three of us ended up chatting after the finish about how much\r\n    fun that last lap had been. This really is a huge part of why I\r\n    love these local races-- even if you're sitting well off the\r\n    podium, there will be a few other riders at your level and you can\r\n    have a great time just racing <em>them</em>. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> So, how did I fare with my goals for this race?\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Line up early, start strong, and hang with the lead pack as\r\n        long as I can.</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Check!\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>The race takes shape on the one and only climb. Give it all I've got.</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> The course change made this one moot. But I did manage to find a\r\n    decisive moment (the last few climbs before the speedy finish) and\r\n    make the most of it. So I'm happy with this one.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Don't finish last.</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Check! Solid mid-pack finish and a ride I'm happy with.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Keep my head in the game, and have fun.</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Check!\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I've been looking to put my bad day\r\n    at <a href=\"archive/3304\">Santiago</a> behind me, and I did that.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> So... what now?\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I <em>really</em> want to do more of these next year. I had a\r\n    great time, and I'm now super-motivated to get into better shape.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> My endurance is fine for these short races. Last night's race was\r\n    about 10 minutes longer than usual, and I picked up\r\n    at <em>least</em> 2 positions in that last 10 minutes.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> And while I can feel that the weight training is helping, my\r\n    top-end W/kg is where I lacked last night. So I'm on the right\r\n    track. The plan is more heavy deadlifts and squats, and looking to\r\n    get my weight down under 175 lbs.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> All in all, great fun, and I can't wait to jump in again next year!\r\n</p>\r\n",

    "Intro": "<p> I got the chance to explore a little more of Chino Hills State\r\n    park last week. I think my <a href=\"archive/3332\">recent\r\n    experiences on new trails</a> made me cocky. I should have done\r\n    more research, and\r\n    found <a href=\"https://www.mtbproject.com/trail/7012139\">this\r\n    loop</a>. (I'd have shortened it, but still.)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> The riding was mostly on fire roads. What little singletrack I did\r\n    find was in really rough shape. And the heat &amp; unfamiliar\r\n    territory made\r\n    the <a href=\"https://www.strava.com/segments/7060984\">Bobcat\r\n    Ridge</a> climb (570', 1.7 mi) feel <em>far</em> harder than it\r\n    really is. (Before I saw the numbers, I'd have compared it to the\r\n    second half\r\n    of <a href=\"https://www.strava.com/segments/635786\">Bulldog</a>. Now\r\n    that seems laughable.)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> But the views from the ridgeline look south over the 91 Freeway\r\n    toward Coal Cyn, and east over Yorba Linda &amp; Brea, and if you\r\n    squint a little I feels a lot like the Rocky Peak Fire Road above\r\n    Simi Valley. There are definitely times I'm homesick for that\r\n    mountain. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n",

    "Intro": "<p> I was in Glendale for work this week, which is a rough enough\r\n    commute that I stayed at a hotel Monday and Wednesday nights so\r\n    that I'd only have to make the drive once a day.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Of course, the bike addict in me immediately seized on the\r\n    opportunity: <em>This means I have two evenings to kill, and I can\r\n    bring my bike!</em>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n",
    "Body": "<p> We've come a <em>long</em> way from the days\r\n    of <a href=\"archive/2170\">paper maps and cue sheets</a>. The\r\n    combination of Strava's route planning features and GPS devices\r\n    made it insanely easy to find places to ride, map out planned\r\n    routes, and load them onto my Garmin so that once I was on the\r\n    bike, I just had to listen for the little burp from my Garmin that\r\n    tells me I'm <em>off</em> course, and otherwise just enjoy the\r\n    ride.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Glendale Sports Complex Ride</h3>\r\n\r\n<p> On Monday I parked at the Glendale Sports Complex and explored the\r\n    ridges above. Fun switchbacks, and short, punchy climbs were the\r\n    norm, as well as a fair bit of fire road climbing. I worked in as\r\n    much singletrack as I could. Liz's Loop was a highlight: a sweet\r\n    bit of singletrack looking north across Pasadena and La Canada\r\n    Flintridge to the San Gabriel mountains.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I had a lot of fun on this loop, and very nearly returned on\r\n    Wednesday. But I'm glad I didn't.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>JPL Loop: Fern Up, El Prieto Cyn Down</h3>\r\n\r\n<p> This is a <em>spectacular</em> loop in Pasadena. I found it and\r\n    rode it in the correct direction (clockwise) by blind\r\n    luck. (The <a href=\"https://www.mtbproject.com/trail/7011443\">MTB\r\n    Project</a> has details on this exact loop, but I somehow found it\r\n    the hard way, by tinkering with the Strava route building tool.)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Fern is a smooth single/doubletrack climb that countours up the\r\n    west side of a ridgeline north of JPL. Monday's punchy climbs\r\n    didn't really leave me with much gas in the tank, so just focused\r\n    on keeping a steady pace and enjoying the ride.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> When I reached the lookout, I really would have loved to keep\r\n    climbing up to Wella's Peak, but I had to admit that I wasn't sure\r\n    I had the legs for it, and I wanted to leave a little gas in the\r\n    tank in case the return leg down El Prieto was more demanding than\r\n    expeced. (Or in case something else went wrong.) So I took a\r\n    minute to enjoy the few, and headed down.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I'm <em>so</em> glad I saved my legs for El Prieto. It's\r\n    an <em>amazing</em> trail down a breathtaking canyon, and it's\r\n    full of super-fun technical features that kept me on my toes. (It\r\n    earns it's <a href=\"https://www.mtbproject.com/trail/916170\">black\r\n    diamond rating</a>.) I walked a few sections, and my switchback\r\n    game <a href=\"https://www.strava.com/segments/1656249\">isn't what\r\n    it was</a>, but man, I'll jump at the next chance I get to ride\r\n    this trail again.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Random Thoughts &amp; Takeaways</h3>\r\n\r\n<p> With less time to ride lately, I'm torn between two sides of my\r\n    personality. Part of me wants to log big climbs and long rides\r\n    when I get the chance. In fact, I had originally planned to climb\r\n    <a href=\"https://www.strava.com/segments/1360087\">Brand Cyn</a>,\r\n    which would have been satisfying but boring. And I thought about\r\n    repeating the Glendale Sports Complex ride to see how fast I could\r\n    do it now that I knew the route.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I'm glad I listened to the other part, which told me to take\r\n    advantage of the chance to ride somewhere new, even if there was a\r\n    decent chance the trail might not be great. I lucked into an\r\n    absolutely stellar loop.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> And, honestly, online resources like Strava and MTB Project are\r\n    making it easier and easier to find &amp; ride really great\r\n    trails. With just a little effort, the odds of a dud trail ride\r\n    are getting increasingly remote.\r\n</p>\r\n",

    "Body": "<p> A scheduling snafu left me with some extra time to ride last\r\n    Friday (How often does <em>that</em> happen!), but I'm not sure I\r\n    should have taken the bait. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> It was a long ride (for me), about 1:20, and included the interval\r\n    workout I'd planned on doing. It didn't <em>feel</em> that rough,\r\n    but my legs were <em>super</em> tired over the weekend, and I\r\n    could feel that I needed to let them rest\r\n    (no <a href=\"archive/3322\">nano-workouts</a>!) and I considered\r\n    making this week a back-off week. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> But on Monday I felt reasonably ready to ride, so I did my normal\r\n    interval sesession, but kept the total volume to a minimum. Warm\r\n    up, work out, be done.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I felt sluggish for Wednesday's \"LSD\" ride, and even got passed by\r\n    a guy on an old mountain bike with a fishing pole and tackle box\r\n    bungeed to the back. I was struggling into the wind at the time,\r\n    and not really paying attention, and was wobbling right down the\r\n    middle of the path. He said something about \"kind of a roadblock\"\r\n    as he went by. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Humbling.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Remember, kids, no matter how hard you work to get better at\r\n    something, and no matter how much you love it, there's someone out\r\n    there who can kick your ass without even trying, and totally\r\n    doesn't care.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Today's intervals went really well. Had to push a little to hit\r\n    170, but generally ok. I'm looking forward to some stretching and\r\n    rest this weekend.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Lee McCormack posted\r\n    a <a href=\"http://www.leelikesbikes.com/feel-your-butt-for-extra-pedal-power.html\">great\r\n    tip about using your glutes</a> a couple of weeks back, and I've\r\n    been working on that. His recommendation was to anticipate the top\r\n    of the pedal stroke so that you engage your glutes right at the\r\n    top.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I couldn't get the timing right. So instead of thinking\r\n    about <em>timing</em>, adjusted the \"target\" I was pushing toward.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Instead of pushing straight down through the bottom of the pedal\r\n    revolution, I pushed down and <em>away</em>, through a point about\r\n    40&deg;\r\n    <em>forward</em> of the bottom.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Nitpicky, certainly. But I can feel my glutes and low back\r\n    engaging much more, and that'll help my climbing. (And over time\r\n    is probably nicer on my knees.)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I thought I'd get bored with bike path rides really fast,\r\n    but <a href=\"archive/3324\">getting better</a> really is a powerful\r\n    motivator for me. By giving my lunchtime rides a purpose (treating\r\n    them like training sessions, with performance goals), I've made\r\n    them into something that keeps me motivated and interested. It's\r\n    like going to the gym. It's not \"real\" riding, but it's an\r\n    abstraction, like the squat rack or the treadmill.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> The plan for this week is more of the same: intervals, LSD,\r\n    intervals. For now, that works for my body. (Especially since the\r\n    intervals are essentially all-out.)\r\n</p>\r\n",

    "Body": "\r\n<p> So, I've picked the following movements:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li> 1-arm KB swing x 20 @ 50#\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li> 1-arm KB snatch x 20 @ 35#\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li> push-up x 8 @ BW\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li> 1-arm KB clean &amp; press x 10 @ 50#\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li> Turkish get-up x 2 @ 50#\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p> I'm trying to accumulate 7-10 sets of each every week. I have a\r\n    little app on my phone that counts things, and I'm using it to for\r\n    this. (It currently tells me I'm totally slacking on the TGU's for\r\n    instance.)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> That lets me use my lunchtimes for stuff that\r\n    actually <em>requires</em> a continuous block: cycling & general\r\n    cardio.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I've been doing a hyper-condensed version of Steady Effort Power\r\n    Interval workout from <em>The Time-Crunched Cyclist</em>:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li> 10-15min @ 140bpm, 90rpm\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li> 5 work intervals:\r\n        <ul>\r\n            <li> 2min @ 170+bpm, 90+rpm\r\n            </li>\r\n            <li> 3min rest @ 140bpm, 90rpm\r\n            </li>\r\n        </ul>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p> I'll steadily reduce the rest between intervals, increase the\r\n    number of work intervals, etc. until I max out my use of the time\r\n    I have.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> All of this is going <em>really</em> well. I've accumulated more\r\n    than 3:30 of saddle time this week, and I've got 3-5 sets of\r\n    everything except the TGUs. I finished out the remaining sets over\r\n    the weekend (except the TGUS... totally slacking on those and I\r\n    start again today.\r\n</p>\r\n",

    "Intro": "<p> I have a new baby daughter at home, a wife I adore, a demanding\r\n    full-time job, and no gym membership. The office where I work\r\n    doesn't have a shower. And yet I logged four solid workouts last\r\n    week.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> So yeah. This is going way, way better than I expected. So many\r\n    people (and training programs) ask, \"How much do I have to train\r\n    to achieve my goal?\" I think it's far more effective to ask, \"What\r\n    can I accomplish in the time I have?\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> In a more general sense, the key lies in asking not, \"Where can I\r\n    find what I want?\" but rather, \"What can I do with what I have?\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I have 30-40 minutes a day, and easy access to a bike path along a\r\n    huge concrete flood control channel. I'm determined to make the\r\n    most of those resources.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n",
    "Body": "<h3>Running</h3>\r\n\r\n<p> Running has been unexpectedly nice. I like the simplicity of it. I\r\n    like that I can get a solid workout in 20 minutes, and I like that\r\n    I've gotten a chance to break out some of\r\n    my <a href=\"http://www.patagonia.com/product/mens-houdini-windbreaker-jacket/24141.html?dwvar_24141_color=ANDB&cgid=root#tile-5=&q=houdini&lang=en_US&start=1&sz=24\">favorite\r\n    gear</a> and get out and about in some beautiful, but chilly,\r\n    weather. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Cycling</h3>\r\n\r\n<p> My cycling plan is to look again at some of the concepts from\r\n    the <a href=\"archive/3021\">Time-Crunched Training Protocol</a> and\r\n    see what I can use. Intervals are pretty much the textbook example\r\n    of how to make the most of limited training time.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I'd initially worried that having only a straight, flat bike path\r\n    to ride on would hamper my training. Certainly, I expect my\r\n    climbing to suffer a bit. But I'm pleased that I get to attack a\r\n    major weakness of mine: flats. (And, I suspect, a general tendency\r\n    to fade as hard efforts continue.) This also gives me a chance to\r\n    work on my pedaling technique.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Kettlebells</h3>\r\n\r\n<p> A heavy kettlebell is bascally a portable gym. I bring my 50# with\r\n    me and work out in the park a couple blocks from the office. It\r\n    takes about 45 minutes, including the drive to/from the park.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>Inline Skates</h3>\r\n\r\n<p> Skates are <em>perfect</em> for long, flat bike paths. And there's\r\n    reason to believe that skating is <em>excellent</em> training for\r\n    cycling. Honestly, though, skating is the <em>bottom</em> item on\r\n    the priority list at the moment. Once fair weather lines up with a\r\n    \"rest day\", I'll lace up my skates and get out there. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Cleanup</h3>\r\n\r\n<p> We don't have showers at work. So I've been doing\r\n    the <a href=\"archive/3318\">cleanup routine</a> that I cobbled together\r\n    from various bits of advice I found online. It seems to work well.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n    <li> Dry off sweat with clean towell\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li> Clean up with <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00B8EDYPK/ref=od_aui_detailpages00?ie=UTF8&psc=1\">disposable wash cloths</a>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li> Splash water on my face & hair, dry with paper towel.\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li> Refresh hair gel, apply deoderant, etc.\r\n    </li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p> I've asked a couple friends at work to give me a heads-up if I'm\r\n    ever... <em>not so fresh</em>. So far, so good.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "Intro": "<p> I've been thinking often\r\n    of <a href=\"http://www.jilloutside.com/2016/08/outside-looking-in.html\">this\r\n    post</a> by Jill Homer, where she wrestles with health setbacks\r\n    that have forced her to reassess her goals for the year:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n    Recently I had an enlightening e-mail conversation with another\r\n    cyclist about self-defining tenets and the unsettling experience\r\n    of losing these pieces of our identities. People who identify as\r\n    athletes are endlessly vulnerable to health setbacks, injuries,\r\n    changes in circumstance, and aging[.]\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p> Aging: check. I just turned 40. Changes in circumstance: check. My\r\n    wife and I just became parents for the first time.\r\n</p>",
    "Body": "\r\n\r\n<p> Talking with friends and family about this has been\r\n    difficult. They struggle to understand the reasons I mountain bike\r\n    in the first place, and why it's so painful to think of losing.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I don't ride or lift or play with kettlebells to make my\r\n    cardiologist happy. I do not do it because \"staying in shape\"\r\n    makes me happy. I ride and work out because <em>riding and working\r\n    out</em> makes me happy. The workout isn't the means. It's the\r\n    end.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> And for the last few months, I've been agonizing over how to\r\n    essentially build a lifeboat for that part of me that is a\r\n    mountain biker, so that I can reclaim him <em>if</em> my life ever\r\n    allows it. I've thought of this entirely in terms of saying in\r\n    shape for the next few years, how to preserve my fitness so that I\r\n    can get back to enjoying that fitness <em>some day</em>.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> And that just made me even <em>more</em> sad, because I'm getting\r\n    my <em>own</em> motivation backward. I should know myself well\r\n    enough to know that treating fitness as the primary goal isn't\r\n    going to motivate me. I shouldn't be looking for a way to <em>stay\r\n    in shape</em>, I should be looking for a <em>challenging\r\n    workout</em> that fits into my life.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Yes, there's a certain level of practicality required here. But I\r\n    need to work within my own psychology so that my goal isn't \"stay\r\n    in shape\", but rather \"continue to be someone who gets outside and\r\n    works hard.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> The general plan is lunchtime workouts, with a smattering of\r\n    kettlebells, inline skating, running, and maybe some bike\r\n    intervals.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> With the arrival of a new member of the family, the primary focus\r\n    will be taking care of my child and my wife, and continuing to\r\n    bring my A game to work every day.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> But I also need to take care of myself. And that means continuing\r\n    to work out consistently and intensely. So, in the spirit\r\n    of <a href=\"archive/2672\">preparedness and opportunity</a>, I'm\r\n    getting set to take advantage of my lunch break if/when I can. I\r\n    figure if I can do that a few times a week, I'll avoid totally\r\n    slacking off on fitness.\r\n</p>\r\n",
